<div class="entry-content"><p>One of the biggest investments I made into my own education in the field was when I convinced my boss to purchase an mp3 player (It was a Zune back in the day and was perfect for the job). My company didn't seem to mind spending several thousand once a year to send me to a developer conference, but in comparison, a cheap purchase of a music player that I could sync Podcasts to was the best investment my employer could have made. With almost 1.5 hours in the car a day, I was able to soak up a ton of technology related information each and every day. My co-workers were always wondering where and how I was always coming up with the this stuff...</p>
<p>If you have a smart phone, you have a great podcast player. Look into some 3rd party apps for your phone (the built-in ones didn't cut it for me).</p>
<h1>Choosing some podcasts</h1>
<p>When picking what podcasts to listen to, there are several approaches I take.</p>
<p>When I don't know what's out there, I like to browse iTunes for a search term, select a few in the area of interest, download a few shows per podcast. While listening to podcasts, I pay attention to other shows that are mentioned or recommended. Don't feel like you have to commit to the podcast, if you listen to a few shows and you don't like it, don't listen to it. There is so much good content out there that you should never feel you need to listen to something that isn't going to keep your interest.</p>
<h1>When to listen.</h1>
<p>I no longer commute 1.5 hours (total) a day since I started <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2014/12/thoughts-on-working-remotely-from-home/">working remotely</a>, but that doesn't mean I don't have time to listen to my podcasts. In fact, the number of podcasts that I subscribe to (and listen to) has actually gone up since my commuter day's. Wish I knew about the 1.5X play speed back in the day...</p>
<p>Time/places to consume the content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Obviously commuting to work is a great place to listen to podcasts. Put down the crappy celebrity gossip ridden radio talk show and soak up some educational podcasts. But since I don't commute anymore I use other time to get my listen on.</li>
<li>Doing household chores. Folding laundry, or putting away dishes is a great time to be listening to podcasts.</li>
<li>Shuttling kids to/from practice. It's funny I actually heard on a <a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-240-podcasts-for-startup-founders">Startups for the rest of us</a> episode where Rob said:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>And the one other thing I do is, let’s say I’m going to go travel, from the time that I step in my car and leave my house, I have an earbud in. So I drive to the airport with an earbud in. I get out, I check in, I go through security, all with an earbud in. I wait and I get on the plane, and on the plane, maybe I’ll watch a movie, but if I’m going to try to sleep, typically I’ll listen to podcast. So there is like hours on both ends of a flight as an example. I can churn through 30 podcast episodes as long as I delete some, I’ll skip a few or I’ll skip around, that kind of stuff. I also have an earbud in when I’m making breakfast in the morning. I have one when I’m making dinner in the evening, when I’m doing dishes, when I’m out doing yard work, when I’m taking out the trash. Like most of my off time, when I’m not with my kids and when I’m kind of doing manual tasks. Even if it’s like five minutes of manual tasks, I can crank through stuff. So that’s kind of my process. How about you? - See more at: <a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-240-podcasts-for-startup-founders#sthash.RMZtrseu.dpuf">http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-240-podcasts-for-startup-founders#sthash.RMZtrseu.dpuf</a></p>

<h1>Survey of the land</h1>
<p>Keeping up on podcasts are a great way to get a solid survey of the technical landscape. Hearing about certain technologies multiple times on different podcasts may be a clue to begin looking into it yourself. Or hearing an in-depth podcast on topic X that you'll probably never use won't hurt you because if you can understand that it solves a problem you may be able to recall it when you are presented with similar problem and be able to dig it back up.</p>
