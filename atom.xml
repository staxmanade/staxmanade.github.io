<p>To host your blog for free by GitHub, you are not required to buy a custom domain so this is an optional step, but one I took.</p>
<p>The reason I have a complete post on this topic is primarily to say that I was able to accomplish this while not even at my desk.</p>
<p>While out waiting for my daughter to complete practice, I sat on my iPhone and was able to not only buy the domain name <a href="http://staxmanade.com">staxmanade.com</a> but I also configured the CNAME on GitHub. By the time I got home from my daughters practice, I could hit my blog through the new domain <a href="http://staxmanade.com">staxmanade.com</a>. Exciting!</p>
<p>You can use <a href="http://codercorral.com/blog/2013/07/24/how-to-setup-a-custom-domain-with-octopress-slash-github-pages/">this post</a> for a quick and simple walk through.</p>

<p>So far we have mostly delt with getting the old blog content into our new Octopress blog. In this post I&#39;ll talk about how I setup automatic redirection from the old blog to the new blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry, this post gets a little long, mostly because there is lots evolved, and I took some time to explain it along the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I&#39;m not an SEO expert or even novice, and I hope the steps I took below actually gave me my end goal. I <em>think</em> they did, but let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves. If you have any feedback, please drop me a line in the comments or in a <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/staxmanade.github.io/issues">github issue for this blog</a>.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-for-redirection-">Reasons for redirection:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;d like people to arrive at my new site even if they followed a link to the old BlogSpot location and get all the benefits of the new site (new theme, broken links fixed, etc)</li>
<li>The whole reason <a href="/2014/04/migrating-blogspot-to-octopress-part-1-introduction">I did this</a> was to &#39;migrate&#39; not, start fresh.</li>
</ul>
<p>I probably won&#39;t ever <code>delete</code> my <code>staxmanade.blogspot.com</code> blog due to outside blogs, articles and sites that have linked to posts I&#39;ve made in the past, but at least they will end up at my new blog.</p>
<h3 id="goals-for-the-redirection-">Goals for the redirection.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Users who click on a link to the old blog should redirect successfully to the new site.</li>
<li><p>I would love it if Google and other search engines could follow a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301">301 Moved Permanently</a> redirection with the hopes that my old blog&#39;s search rankings would carry over to my new blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DISCLAIMER: Given the steps in the post, I&#39;m not 100% confident that this goal was accomplished, but I think it may have worked (maybe, possibly, ???)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, while I&#39;m not 100% confident my search rankings carried over, I&#39;m fairly confident that Google found out about my new blog because after just 2 days of the below steps being implemented, Google had already indexed the new site.</p>
<h1 id="what-s-involved-for-redirection-">What&#39;s involved for redirection?</h1>
<ol>
<li>Tell BlogSpot to redirect each post at <code>staxmanade.blogspot.com</code> to the new location.</li>
<li>Handle that redirection on the Octopress side.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a number of posts out there that describe how to accomplish this with WordPress or other blogs that can host a dynamic server side component. However with Octopress or other statically generated sites we don&#39;t have as easy a time. I belive this has more to do with the lack of programmability on the BlogSpot side (or my lack of knowledge of how far you can go with it on their side) than the static-ness of our Octopress blog.</p>
<h3 id="let-s-get-into-why-this-wasn-t-as-straight-forward-">Let&#39;s get into why this wasn&#39;t as straight forward.</h3>
<p>If you look at how to redirect from a <a href="http://www.shoutmeloud.com/how-to-migrate-from-blogspot-to-wordpress-with-301-permanent-redirection-without-loosing-traffic.html">BlogSpot blog to say WordPress</a> you&#39;ll see that they are basically passing the FULL original url EX:<code>http://staxmanade.blogspot.com/2013/12/format-your-net-exceptions-to-see.html</code> to a server-side component, where it can dynamically translate that into the correct 301 redirect response needed for each page.</p>
<p>The problem we have is the <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/42095?hl=en">BlogSpot template tags</a> are limited. They don&#39;t provide a <em>relative blog url</em> parameter which would have made it easy. Instead they provide only the full URL <code>&lt;$BlogItemURL$&gt;</code> which we can&#39;t use on our static site.</p>
<p>The direction I took was to use the <code>&lt;$BlogItemNumber$&gt;</code> which is like a really long <code>id</code> value, leverage the <a href="https://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_alias_generator">Jekyll alias generator</a> and end up doing two redirects.</p>
<ol>
<li>from <code>staxmanade.blogspot.com/SomeBlogUrl</code> -&gt; <code>staxmanade.github.io/blog/&lt;$BlogItemNumber$&gt;</code></li>
<li>then from <code>staxmanade.github.io/blog/&lt;$BlogItemNumber$&gt;</code> -&gt; <code>staxmanade.github.io/blog/finalBlogUrl</code></li>
</ol>
<p>On the Octopress side we are going to leverage the <a href="https://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_alias_generator">alias</a> plugin. Once that&#39;s installed, we need to update all of our blog posts to add in the &#39;alias&#39; that will point to th e<code>/blog/{really_long_id}. My scripting hammer is</code>PowerShell<code>*(sorry if you&#39;re reading this on a mac - hey, maybe [Pash](https://github.com/Pash-Project/Pash) can help you if you&#39;re not on Windows)* and I wrote the below script to help in the task. Even if you don&#39;t know</code>PowerShell`, take a moment to read the comments in the code to get an idea of what it is doing.</p>

<p>In summary, the above code is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parsing the blogger xml</li>
<li>Extracting the post url (slug) and BlogSpot blog <code>id</code></li>
<li>Matching each post with a post in our Octopress <code>_posts</code> <a href="/2014/04/migrating-blogspot-to-octopress-part-3-export-blogspot-content">that we recently exported</a></li>
<li>And injecting an <code>alias: /blog/{id}</code> into the header <code>YAML</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Look in your blogger xml for a sample ID, it looks like</p>
<pre><code>&lt;id&gt;tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4726251688144615011.post-7515836382847059837&lt;/id&gt;
</code></pre><p>What we care about is the <code>BigNumber</code> after the &quot;...post-<BigNumber>&quot;. This is the <code>id</code> used in the above script to generate our new <code>/blog/&lt;BitNumber&gt;</code> <a href="https://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_alias_generator">alias</a> url.</p>
<p>If you completed the above and run <code>rake generate</code> and <code>rake preview</code>, test out that your redirections are correct.</p>
<p>After I completed this and on my blog, <a href="https://staxmanade.com/blog/7515836382847059837">staxmanade.com/blog/7515836382847059837</a> should redirect me to an actual post.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;re happy with your Octopress&#39;s blogger redirections, <strong>SHIP IT</strong>. Publish them to your blog and test them out on gihub <code>rake gen_deploy</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have our static site redirecting the special <code>/blog/{id}</code> url&#39;s, we can go back to BlogSpot and update our template to redirect to our static site.</p>
<p>I used the below template (note search/replace your domain etc) before dropping this into your site.</p>
<h1 id="update-blogger-template-to-redirect-">Update Blogger template to redirect.</h1>
<ol>
<li>Go back to your BlogSpot admin page and select the <code>Template</code> tab.</li>
<li>On the lower right you may have to select (forgetting the exact text - but something like) <code>Revert to classic template</code></li>
<li>Modify the below template for your own site.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will change all pages/posts on your old BlogSpot site (even your home page). You can now go test it out - see that it hopefully transitions you from your blogger site -&gt; to the new static redirect - and then to your final post location. It happens so fast I sometimes don&#39;t see the middle/transition page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I had to run through this a few times before I got it right so be careful doing this (especially if you have a popular blog as it may interrupt users at the current time). I&#39;m not that cool, so my blog could handle some downtime :P</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve ported your content into Octopress there were several steps I used to fixup links. The two types of links I cared about at this stage were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross-Post links (where I referenced one of my other posts)</li>
<li>Broken links.</li>

<p>I used a text editor and some command line magic to search for <code>http://staxmanade.blogspot.com/</code> and replace it with <code>/blog/</code> so that my cross-referencing posts could link to a relative version of the blog instead of the full blogspot domain.</p>
<p>Depending on how you configure your <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/">permalinks</a> you may need to do some more link manipulation. I had to search <code>.html</code> at the end of my cross-referencign posts and be sure to delete it since my old reference would look like</p>
<pre><code>http://staxmanade.blogspot.com/2013/12/format-your-net-exceptions-to-see.html
</code></pre><p>but now should link to</p>
<pre><code>/blog/2013/12/format-your-net-exceptions-to-see
</code></pre><p>If you&#39;re on Windows and not interested in figuring out a <code>PowerShell</code> or other command to quickly search and replace, a friend of mine <a href="http://programmerpayback.com/about/">Tim Greenfield</a> has a great utility GUI tool for easy <a href="https://seeker.codeplex.com">search and replace</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t recall exactly what I did, I think I either used <code>sed</code> or a python command on my Mac for the initial search/replace. I&#39;ll let you figure out the rest of how to get that task done.</p>
<h2 id="fix-broken-links">Fix broken links</h2>
<p>Once you&#39;re done fixing up cross-post links, we want to make sure we didn&#39;t mess anything up, and while we&#39;re at it, fix any old or out-dated links.</p>
<p>One great feature of <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> is that we can run the site locally and use a spider tool to search for broken links.  Run <code>rake generate</code> and <code>rake preview</code> locally to browse your site.</p>
<p>I used the <a href="http://peacockmedia.co.uk/integrity/">Integrity link checker</a> on my Mac to search the <code>http://localhost:4000</code> site locally. There are lots of these tools out there, so feel free to use what you feel happy with.</p>
<p>This was a great exercise. Not only debugging any <em>oopsies</em> from the above cross-post fixup step, but allowed me to find any external links to blogs/images/etc that were out of date. I wasn&#39;t able to fix up all of my external links, but that&#39;s the way of the web unfortunately. I haven&#39;t done it yet, but have consider going back and linking the out-dated links to a version out on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/">Way Back Machine</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/2014/04/migrating-blogspot-to-octopress-part-2-setup-octopress">previous post</a> I discussed how to export your blog content from BlogSpot. Now that you have all of your content into a single <code>.xml</code> file, we need to translate that into the files and format that Octopress blog expects.</p>
<h1 id="translate-export-xml-to-octopress-posts">Translate export <code>xml</code> to Octopress posts</h1>
<p>Thanks to a ruby script found in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/juniorz/1564581">gist</a>, it&#39;s fairly easy to get going provided you are able to leverage all the gem dependencies with your installation of ruby. On Windows this is tricky although fortunately there are tools like <a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/yari">yari</a> to help out.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and save one of these <a href="https://gist.github.com/dnagir/1765496/forks">gists</a> somewhere and call it <code>BloggerImporter.rb</code><ul>
<li>Note: there are a number of forks of the script - if one doesn&#39;t work, browse other changes and see if something fits your needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>From the command line go to a temporary folder and execute</p>
<p> <code>ruby {pathToImporterFile}/BloggerImporter.rb &#39;{PathToBloggerExport}/blog-03-19-2014.xml&#39;</code></p>
<p> When I tried it on my windows machine I received the following error. Sorry Windows folks, I don&#39;t have answers for every scenario here - I just jumped over to my Mac and tried again. I remember first trying this like a year ago and ran down a similar rat-hole trying to get this dependency to work which is probably why I didn&#39;t port it back then. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible, but wasn&#39;t worth my time (since it works on my mac and was a one-time task).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-ruby"> C:/Ruby193/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require&#39;: cannot load such file -- nokogiri (LoadE
 rror)
         from C:/Ruby193/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require&#39;
         from BloggerImporter.rb:2:in `&lt;main&gt;&#39;
</code></pre>
<p> (One possible issue noted by a colleague: the ruby script requires a gem, <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokigiri</a>, which is not supported on Windows by Ruby 2 at the time of this writing. This can be circumvented by either reinstalling Ruby 1.9.3 or by leveraging a tool like yari which allows you to pick the version of Ruby you wish to leverage with a script - a helpful StackOverflow answer exists <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/17318410/64">here</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>You should now you have your content.</p>
<p> After you&#39;ve run the <code>BloggerImporter.rb</code> command you should have at least two folders in your temporary folder.</p>
<pre><code> ~/code/temp&gt; ls
 _drafts     _posts    BloggerImporter.rb
</code></pre><p> I didn&#39;t end up caring about anything in my <code>_drafts</code> folder, but the <code>_posts</code> folder is full of gold. This contains all of your exported content now broken out into a separate file per post in the form of <code>{year}-{month}-{day}-{title}.html</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Copy this content into the Octopress blog folder under <code>source/_posts/</code></p>
</li>
<li>At this point you&#39;ve successfully ported your content into your Octopress blog. Make sure you take tiny steps and <code>git commit...</code> the changes you care about along the way...</li>
<li>Use <code>rake generate</code> and <code>rake preview</code> to see if it worked. </li>
<li>If your preview looks right use <code>rake deploy</code> to put your changes on github.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully it all worked out and you&#39;re looking at your new Octopress blog with your old content all there. If I recall when I went through this process, there was one HTML file that <code>Jekyll</code> had issues compiling. I probably just modified the post or deleted somethign that wasn&#39;t necessary (I can&#39;t recall anymore) but it was quick to work through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>side note: When I initially tried getting <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> to work after this and had trouble. <strong>Turned out this was because in the YAML metadata in each post <code>comments: false</code></strong> :)</p>

<p>Thanks to Google for allowing us to <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/97416?hl=en">export our own content</a> and providing an easy way to get it all in one download. If we had to go manually read each item in an atom feed or web scrape the content off of a web page, this small series would be more like a novel...</p>
<h1 id="steps-to-export-content-">Steps to export content.</h1>
<ol>
<li>Log in to your [BlogSpot.com(<a href="http://BlogSpot.com">http://BlogSpot.com</a>) admin portal</li>
<li>Go to the <code>Settings</code> tab</li>
<li>Select the <code>Other</code> option under Settings</li>
<li>Under Blog tools select <code>Export blog</code></li>
<li>Save the file somewhere safe so we can refer to it later</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-s-in-this-export-file-">What&#39;s in this export file?</h2>
<p>This file contains the raw content and metadata around each of your blog posts. You won&#39;t get any of your images, but all of your original blog images are probably hosted on external sites. This is next on my list of things to add to the port-list (and will possibly extend this series even more). I would like to download each of my images locally, save them to my Octopress <a href="http://github.com/staxmanade/staxmanade.github.io">git repo</a> and update my posts to link to the local versions of the images (but that&#39;s lower on the priority).</p>
<p>Here is a snippet of a single entry from the exported file. In later posts we&#39;ll delv deeper into this to extract metadata an setup redirection from BlogSpot to our new blog.</p>

    &lt;title type=&#39;text&#39;&gt;Format your .Net exceptions to see the StackTrace.&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;content type=&#39;html&#39;&gt;&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;TL;DR&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Check out a dinky little &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://staxmanade.github.io/ExceptionMessageBeautifier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;Exception Message Beautifier&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; site I threw together so you can quickly format .net exception messages and easily see the StackTrace.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Go to the site: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://staxmanade.github.io/ExceptionMessageBeautifier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&amp;gt;CLICK HERE&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Background&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the years, I’ve worked on projects where application exceptions were saved to a SQL database. When querying the logs in Visual Studio or in Sql Management Studio’s table view, I would get a result-set that would not let me copy/paste and review the StackTrace easily. The tool always seemed to leave out the new line characters just like below.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;System.Exception: Hello Exception!   at TestExceptionGenerator.Spike.GetException() in c:\Code\personal\DotNetExceptionMessageFormatter\TestExceptionGenerator\Spike.cs:line 22   at TestExceptionGenerator.Spike.b__0() in c:\Code\personal\DotNetExceptionMessageFormatter\TestExceptionGenerator\Spike.cs:line 13   at TestExceptionGenerator.Extensions.GetExceptionString(Action action) in c:\Code\personal\DotNetExceptionMessageFormatter\TestExceptionGenerator\Spike.cs:line 34&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, I know there are ways to get around this, like exporting to CSV, or setting up the query results to return in text view instead of table view. However, when you’re in the heat of tracking down a bug and don’t feel like you have time to find the settings dialog or open up you’re a text editor like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://notepad-plus-plus.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;NotePad++&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and enter a search/replace as I show below over and over with each exception message you review.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/-FGWJCcb9iUo/UrJs8rxtvqI/AAAAAAAAAik/uWK5NHFfU18/s1600-h/image15.png&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Eo5EyWOkIm0/UrJs9Dr20HI/AAAAAAAAAio/9-9wJIb1K1c/image_thumb9.png?imgmax=800&quot; width=&quot;443&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just so I could see an exception that looked more like:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;System.Exception: Hello Exception! &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; at TestExceptionGenerator.Spike.GetException() in …&amp;amp;lt;cut off for brevity&amp;amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; at TestExceptionGenerator.Spike.b__0() in …&amp;amp;lt;cut off for brevity&amp;amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; at TestExceptionGenerator.Extensions.GetExceptionString(Action action) in …&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I finally buckled down and threw together a tool for this. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;You can check go check out &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://staxmanade.github.io/ExceptionMessageBeautifier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;Exception Message Beautifier&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; where you can see the sample below.&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Ts_VJAZqmu4/UrJs9i36LfI/AAAAAAAAAiw/j4jZDVL2Z-Y/s1600-h/image3.png&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img title=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/-YwT0ZJIBFSA/UrJs93yI9aI/AAAAAAAAAi4/eg2rZr285QE/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800&quot; width=&quot;689&quot; height=&quot;354&quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;I’d like to thank.&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Below are a list of tools/resources I leveraged to put the site together relatively quickly over the weekend.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;CodePen.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; where I first prototyped/built my site before porting it into the GitHub pages. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;GitHub&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for providing us with &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;GitHub Pages&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.

<p>Luckily for all of us, this post will be short as the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">Octopress Setup</a> guide is a great place to start. Only additions I have to add are that I&#39;ve set this up on both a Mac and a Windows 8 machine.</p>
<p>I had to execute the <code>rake setup_github_pages[repo]</code> on both machines. I should probably <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PleaseLearnToThinkAboutAbstractions.aspx">look under the abstraction</a> and understand a little deeper - but I&#39;ll have to save that for later. For now I have work to do...</p>
<h3 id="on-my-mac-">On my Mac:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Things worked out quite smoothly on the Mac.</li>
<li>This is where I ran my initial import of the blog (see later posts in the series).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-my-windows-8-machine-">On my Windows 8 machine:</h3>
<ul>
<li>This environment seemed harder to get going</li>
<li>The hardest part on Windows 8 was getting the right combination of ruby, ruby dev kit, and various other dependencies installed. The dependencies for Octopress installation are compatible with later versions of Ruby but the gems needed for blog import are only supported in Ruby 1.9.3 at the time of this writing. Since I don&#39;t use Ruby on Windows for anything else, I eventually ended up uninstalling all versions I&#39;d previously had (including cleaning up any environment path variables). Re-installing just what I needed and eventually got it working. Another route is to use <a href="https://github.com/scottmuc/yari">Scott Muc&#39;s yari</a> which allows you to toggle the version of Ruby that you&#39;re using.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.zerosharp.com/setting-up-octopress-on-windows/">Thanks to this post</a> to get started on the windows. Some steps I excluded since I&#39;d alredy setup the blog initially on my Mac.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I can use the power of git to manage my website and blog and I can leverage whatever development tools I would like depending on the platform. If you are new to Octopress it is helpful to study the documentation and structure of the files within your cloned repository. The first thing to note is that you have two branches in the repository: the source branch contains the Ruby scripts and utilities you will use to generate your blog content. The master branch is where your published content will live. The second thing to note is that while you can do the git integrations yourself for deploying the blog, it is best to stick to the RAKE task for deploying your content. This will automate copying your content to the _deploy subdirectory and pushing the update to the master branch. </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After hosting my blog on <a href="http://blogspot.com">BlogSpot.com</a> for over 5 years, it was time to move.</p>
<p>As someone with the development background I have and constantly growing knowledge of the web, it always bugged me that my blog was hosted on BlogSpot. </p>
<p>When I first started blogging over 5 years ago, it was a great starter site. Free, simple, easy to configure and it was a great place to throw content up with very little friction. But my desire to write posts using <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, host my content on a site where I felt like I had complete control, and lets face it, I just wanted a codebase I could tinker with and throw up coding experiments.</p>
<p>I recently completed migration of my <a href="http://staxmanade.blogspot.com">staxmanade.blogspot.com</a> site to its new location here on <a href="http://staxmanade.com">staxmanade.com</a> which is graciously being hosted for free by <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you currently have a blog on BlogSpot/Blogger and are interested in migrating to Octopress or any other blog, the following series of posts may be of use.</p>

<p>The other day I set out to create an iOS UICollectionView that allowed a user to scroll vertically through an infinite-ish list of items where the data came from a paginated back-end web service. Most of the examples out there deal with synchronous in-memory. I needed an asynchronous paginated example.</p> <p>I&#8217;m new enough to iOS development that solutions don&#8217;t yet roll off the wire of my keyboard, so I still google for how others attack a problem and adapt their strategy to fit my needs.</p> <p>It seemed like it took me all day to track down the pieces I needed to put together a solution. But I found enough to put together a prototype.</p> <p>If you need something like this, I&#8217;ve pushed my prototype up to <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/PaginatedCollectionView">GitHub</a> and hopefully it&#8217;ll give you enough hints to get started on your own implementation.</p> <p>I&#8217;m open to feedback. Post any suggestions/alternative ideas to the github repo.</p> <h1>Where do I get it?</h1> <h2><a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/PaginatedCollectionView">HERE</a></h2> <p>Hope you find this useful.</p></div>

<p>A standard task I began placing in my projects lately is one that easily integrates with my build tool of choice (rake, psake, etc&#8230;) and when run, installs a git pre-commit hook into my local copy of the repo that will run tests before code is committ. I&#8217;ve fancied calling the task <em><a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/PutOnAHelmet">putOnAHelmet</a></em>.</p> <p>Come checkout a small <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/PutOnAHelmet">little github repo </a> I started to keep track of various versions of this and feel free to open an issue or send a pull request with another one!</p> <p>I don&#8217;t want to get into details about pre-commit hooks and how you should author them in this post (maybe we can expand the language in the repo&#8217;s readme&#8230;). You can also check <a href="http://bit.ly/1bit9Pe">out other writings</a>&#8230; But one of the biggest problems I have with them is gits in-ability to easily keep track of pre-commit hooks much like it can with the rest of the projects source. </p> <p>Now it&#8217;s true that different people need the ability to customize these, but a general &#8220;running of tests&#8221; before committing is a great first step and I&#8217;ve found these set of tasks the easiest way to carry them from repo to repo.</p> <p>Hope others find this useful!</p> <p>Happy committing!</p></div>

I also split each refactoring out in to a separate commit, and tag the description with &quot;REFACTOR: &quot;. When things go well, I take tiny, safe refactoring steps, commit each one separately, until the feature I&#39;m trying to write is easye to implement. My commit history then looks like this:<br /><br />    REFACTOR: Extract Method `X.Y()`<br />    REFACTOR: Rename `A` -&gt; `B`<br />    Implement feature &quot;Foo&quot;<br /><br />If you are looking for a specific deliberate behavior change, you can scan the history and look at only the non-REFACTOR commits. That commit is small and clear, because I have refactored ahead of time. <br /><br />If you ever see a behavior change under a REFACTOR tag, you know it was not deliberate - that I screwed up.</div>

I&#39;ve tried to work this way for a long time, but wasn&#39;t ever able to articulate it as well as you have.<br /><br />Just 2 days ago I told a coworker to commit his change in two parts, and he looked at me blankly and asked &quot;Why?&quot;. I said &quot;Single-Responsibility Principle&quot; and got more blank. *sigh* </div>

<h4>TL;DR</h4>  <p>Check out a dinky little <a href="http://staxmanade.github.io/ExceptionMessageBeautifier" target="_blank">Exception Message Beautifier</a> site I threw together so you can quickly format .net exception messages and easily see the StackTrace.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h4>Go to the site: <a href="http://staxmanade.github.io/ExceptionMessageBeautifier" target="_blank"><font size="4">CLICK HERE</font></a></h4>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h4>Background</h4>  <p>Over the years, I’ve worked on projects where application exceptions were saved to a SQL database. When querying the logs in Visual Studio or in Sql Management Studio’s table view, I would get a result-set that would not let me copy/paste and review the StackTrace easily. The tool always seemed to leave out the new line characters just like below.</p>  <blockquote>   <pre>System.Exception: Hello Exception!   at TestExceptionGenerator.Spike.GetException() in c:\Code\personal\DotNetExceptionMessageFormatter\TestExceptionGenerator\Spike.cs:line 22   at TestExceptionGenerator.Spike.b__0() in c:\Code\personal\DotNetExceptionMessageFormatter\TestExceptionGenerator\Spike.cs:line 13   at TestExceptionGenerator.Extensions.GetExceptionString(Action action) in c:\Code\personal\DotNetExceptionMessageFormatter\TestExceptionGenerator\Spike.cs:line 34</pre><br /></blockquote><br /><br /><p>&#160;</p><br /><br /><p>Now, I know there are ways to get around this, like exporting to CSV, or setting up the query results to return in text view instead of table view. However, when you’re in the heat of tracking down a bug and don’t feel like you have time to find the settings dialog or open up you’re a text editor like <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">NotePad++</a> and enter a search/replace as I show below over and over with each exception message you review.</p><br /><br /><p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-FGWJCcb9iUo/UrJs8rxtvqI/AAAAAAAAAik/uWK5NHFfU18/s1600-h/image15.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Eo5EyWOkIm0/UrJs9Dr20HI/AAAAAAAAAio/9-9wJIb1K1c/image_thumb9.png?imgmax=800" width="443" height="286" /></a></p><br /><br /><p>Just so I could see an exception that looked more like:</p><br /><br /><blockquote><br />  <p>System.Exception: Hello Exception! <br />    <br />&#160;&#160; at TestExceptionGenerator.Spike.GetException() in …&lt;cut off for brevity&gt; <br /><br />    <br />&#160;&#160; at TestExceptionGenerator.Spike.b__0() in …&lt;cut off for brevity&gt; <br /><br />    <br />&#160;&#160; at TestExceptionGenerator.Extensions.GetExceptionString(Action action) in …&#160;&#160; </p><br /></blockquote><br /><br /><p>I finally buckled down and threw together a tool for this. </p><br /><br /><h3>You can check go check out <a href="http://staxmanade.github.io/ExceptionMessageBeautifier" target="_blank">Exception Message Beautifier</a> where you can see the sample below.</h3><br /><br /><p>&#160;</p><br /><br /><p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Ts_VJAZqmu4/UrJs9i36LfI/AAAAAAAAAiw/j4jZDVL2Z-Y/s1600-h/image3.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-YwT0ZJIBFSA/UrJs93yI9aI/AAAAAAAAAi4/eg2rZr285QE/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800" width="689" height="354" /></a></p><br /><br /><p>&#160;</p><br /><br /><h4>I’d like to thank.</h4><br /><br /><p>Below are a list of tools/resources I leveraged to put the site together relatively quickly over the weekend.</p><br /><br /><ul><br />  <li><a href="http://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen.io</a> where I first prototyped/built my site before porting it into the GitHub pages. </li><br /><br />  <li><a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for providing us with <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.

<div class='post'>
<p>Have you ever arrived at work and sat down, not exactly sure what you were working on the day before? You spend some time going through emails. Start looking at your codebase, maybe the last couple commits you made trying to get back into the mental groove you were in the day before.</p>  <p>There is a <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=get+back+into+programming+after+interruption" target="_blank">lot of information</a> about how long it takes to get back into the programming zone. <strong>If you leave yourself a breadcrumb or two, it is much easier to get started when you come back to your task.</strong></p>  <h3>Some of my favorite breadcrumbs.</h3>  <h4>Leave a failing unit test.</h4>  <p>If you practice any sort of test driven development, leaving a failing test to pick up the next day can be one of the most useful methods to get going again when you come back to the problem. If you’ve spent the time to think through the problem enough to write a failing unit test, this can help to ease you into the task at hand and get rolling the next day. </p>  <h4>Explicitly leave a note or compiler error in the code.</h4>  <p>Now, it’s probably common to check your working code in at the end of the day, but sometimes you just can’t work it to completion. That’s ok, and if you use a tool that supports something like this, leave yourself a breadcrumb of one or more compiler errors.</p>  <p>If I’m writing some C# I sometimes use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/x5hedts0.aspx" target="_blank">#error precompiler</a> directive with a helpful message.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-3BSP6C9ismg/UqFnBqT43GI/AAAAAAAAAiI/BvwY-gpVO-o/s1600-h/image3.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-XgX7jyzCT_c/UqFnCTtDw7I/AAAAAAAAAiQ/o5EgtBxl_vA/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800" width="531" height="177" /></a></p>  <p>This allows me to come in the next day. Hit build on the project and immediately see where I was in the codebase last and need to pick up again.</p>  <h4>Other, less specific, but useful options:</h4>  <ul>   <li>Send yourself an email describing what you’re working on and what still needs to be done. </li>    <li>Write in your favorite notes app. I like to use OneNote to keep track of my ‘scrum notes’ which help me describe what I did today and what I plan on doing tomorrow. </li>    <li>Sticky note? (can’t say I’ve used a pen/paper in a while – but if it works for you go for it)</li> </ul>  <p>It doesn’t have to be anything special, just a little note to yourself that can help you get a jump start on your next task at hand.</p>  <p>What other methods do you use to get back into the problem at hand?</p>  </div>

<div class='post'>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <a href="http://typescriptlang.org" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>, I’d highly recommend checking it out. <strong>It’s my new preferred way to write JavaScript based applications.</strong></p>  <p>If you write an application in TypeScript and need to interact with an external set of either JavaScript or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B/CX" target="_blank">C++/CX</a> dependencies then you will quickly find that you are going to be mucking with some TypeScript Definition files and the more you take a dependency on the WinRT runtime the more type definitions you probably need to manually create.</p>  <p>It’s true that the TypeScript team has created a set of TypeScript Definition files for WinRT and WinJS, but I <a href="https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/462409" target="_blank">couldn’t get any comment</a> as to how they were generated. And the more I looked into what was provided, the more I realized that there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies that were not good. Which led me to believe that they weren’t working on a super-secret tool to automatically generate these for us.</p>  <h3>What is <a href="https://github.com/ToTypeScriptD/ToTypeScriptD" target="_blank">ToTypeScriptD</a> ?</h3>  <p><a href="https://github.com/ToTypeScriptD/ToTypeScriptD" target="_blank">ToTypeScriptD</a> is a quick little attempt at automatically taking the type system provided to us by a C++/CX winmd or .Net assembly file and projecting that into a set of TypeScript Definition files. This tool can basically take anything that is <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm">Ecma 355</a> Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) and spit out a .d.ts file for you automatically.</p>  <h3>Why would I need this?</h3>  <p>In the <a href="https://github.com/ToTypeScriptD/ToTypeScriptD#can-you-tell-me-why-i-would-use-this" target="_blank">project readme</a> I describe two use-cases that I know of (so far).</p>  <ol>   <li>If you build a 'Modern' (come on, we still call it Metro) Windows 8 app with <code>WinJS</code> and want to leverage <code>TypeScript</code>, wouldn't it be nice to get a set of TypeScript Definition files that reflect the native API's you're calling in the platform without manually creating the definition files?       <br></li>    <li>Say your building an MVC/WebAPI server application. It would be useful if your C.I./Build system could generate a set of TypeScript interfaces that were based on the server objects used to render your JSON API. This can be useful for client side JavaScript/TypeScript libraries that need to consume these objects and also provide a simple way to document the format of the input and output API response objects. </li> </ol>  <h3>How do I get the project and start using it?</h3>  <blockquote>   <p>Before you install the tool and dive in head first, I would like warn you that I have only been working on this for about 2 weeks (in my off-hours) and there is going to be lots of room for improvement. But it’s currently generating a solid set of .d.ts files for .winmd files.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/ToTypeScriptD/ToTypeScriptD" target="_blank">project home page</a> and check out the <a href="https://github.com/ToTypeScriptD/ToTypeScriptD" target="_blank">Readme</a> for some quick-start information.</p>  <p>I’d would love to hear feedback. If anyone is interested in helping out, you can submit new issues or review the open issues list and start submitting pull requests.</p>  <p>Happy TypeScripting!</p>  </div>

<p>I’m throwing this out there since I couldn’t find much on this specific problem. #payingItForward</p>  <h4>Problem</h4>  <p>I struggled getting the git command line to authenticate with Git Team Foundation Service online.</p>  <p>My current environment is Windows 8, msysgit, with the git-credential-winstore tool installed. (Love that credential tool)</p>  <p>When I first tried to (push, fetch, or pull) from a newly created TFS Git repository I received git-credential-winstore authentication dialog, entered my credentials and received the following error,</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Failed to erase credential: Element not found      <br />fatal: Authentication failed</p> </blockquote>  <p>After googling that error I found this link <a href="http://blog.jennysjottings.co.uk/2013/01/20/github-glitch/">http://blog.jennysjottings.co.uk/2013/01/20/github-glitch/</a> who’s approach did not work in my case.</p>  <h4>Solution: Short Version</h4>  <ol>   <li>Log into your TFS account (online)</li>    <li>go to your account settings then credentials </li>    <li>setup the alternate login</li> </ol>  <h4>Solution: Long version</h4>  <ol>   <li>First go to the following link:&#160; <a href="http://tfs.visualstudio.com/en-us/learn/use-git-and-xcode-with-tfs.aspx" target="_blank">Use Git&#160; and XCode with TFS</a> </li>    <li>scroll down to the section titled:      <h4>Enable basic authentication for your account</h4>   </li>    <li>Follow those directions</li> </ol>  <h5>Hope this helps.</h5>  <p>Happy Git-ing!</p>  </div>

<p>While working on a little <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/share-data-inspector/c33bae47-43d7-4d1b-bbee-01f09850d6dc" target="_blank">WinRT app</a> I recently spent WAY too much time trying to figure out why I was getting the following exception</p>  <blockquote>   <p>System.UnauthorizedAccessException was unhandled by user code      <br />&#160; HResult=-2147024891       <br />&#160; Message=Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED))       <br />&#160; Source=Windows.UI       <br />&#160; StackTrace:       <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; at Windows.UI.Text.ITextDocument.SetText(TextSetOptions options, String value)</p> </blockquote>  <p>when all I was trying to do was programmatically set the text of a RichEditBox. EX:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>theRichEditBox.<strong>Document.SetText</strong>(Windows.UI.Text.TextSetOptions.FormatRtf, textValue);</p> </blockquote>  <p>After searching and searching and eventually taking a walk to cool down, I decided that I would play with the IsReadOnly flag. I have it set to “True” in the XAML because I don’t want users to edit the text. I then wondered if this was causing the problem.</p>  <p>I tweaked the code as shown below and it magically started working. Notice how I’m turning off the IsReadOnly flag off, then setting the text, and returning the read only state after the text has changed.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>theRichEditBox.<strong>IsReadOnly = false;</strong>       <br />theRichEditBox.<strong>Document.SetText</strong>(Windows.UI.Text.TextSetOptions.FormatRtf, textValue);       <br />theRichEditBox.<strong>IsReadOnly = true;</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>Dear Exception: you were not helpful. Sigh.</p>  </div>

Last weekend I participated in a <a href="http://renohackathon.com/" target="_blank">Windows 8 hackathon</a>. In 24 hours of coding I had an app created and submitted to the App Store for certification.<br /><h4>24 hours to create an app?</h4>I'll share details about the app I created in a future post. <strong>For now, I have since removed my app from the review process in the Developer Portal.</strong><br />Before I get into why I (temporarily) removed my app. I would like to first talk about a number of the real benefits I saw with the hackathon.<br /><ul><li>I work from home as a remote employee. <a href="http://www.bobcowherd.com/2013/03/managing-remote-teams.html?m=1">Don't worry I'm not at Yahoo</a>. The event was a fun change of pace; working in a room of developers hacking away on their own ideas. You could feel the energy and this energy is probably why it was possible to burn the midnight oil hacking on my own app. </li><li>This contest forced me to work all the way through submitting an app to the store which I believe to be more of a mental hurdle than an actual one. This process was definitely made easier with Microsoft on hand to answer questions and get over some of the non-obvious steps in the process. </li><li>Working in a room with the others proved to be useful when you got stuck on something. Shouting out <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jessetanderson/status/308087741256704001">'I'm stuck on problem X</a>’ and have someone there to point you in the right direction and unblock you is great. </li><li>The short timeframe forces you to focus on your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum Viable Product</a>. Work on what is necessary and avoid getting side tracked. </li><li>Related to the focus above I really got into the zone hacking away at my app; this certainly reminded me of why I love this profession. </li><li>Meet developers in the area. </li><li>Learn interesting problem domains and how others tackle them in their apps. </li></ul><h4>Now, why am I really writing this post?</h4><strong>I believe Microsoft is shooting themselves in the foot with how they are running these hackathons.</strong><br />I can’t say I speak for how the hackathons are being run, but my experience showed me the following.<br />With Microsoft’s own employees running these events and <a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/give+a+lick+and+a+promise" target="_blank">not giving a lick</a> to the quality of the applications being submitted they are setting themselves up for failure.<br /><strike>I can see from a marketing perspective that having a large number of apps in the store will help them drive more people to their platform.</strike> That’s crap. There are far too many reasons Microsoft should be driving <strong>QUALITY</strong> into the store and not quantity.<br />Let’s list a few reasons this is going to backfire:<br /><ul><li>NOBODY wants to use crappy apps developed in 24 hours. NOBODY! </li><li>There are very few apps that can be written in 24 hours without maintaining some sort of a quality bar. </li><li>The certification process will get clogged causing the testers to care less about finding quality issues and pounding through “numbers”. </li><li>We'll have a huge collection of crappy apps where the sheer number of apps will make finding a good quality app nearly impossible. </li></ul><h4>How can they make this better?</h4>Something interesting about this is generally when you talk about Pros/Cons to something, you have to give-up something to fix a Con and that sometimes means taking away from the Pros.<br />However, I feel like we can keep ALL of the pros I listed above while also reducing the amount of Cons if only Microsoft incentivized their employees to drive quality into the store.<br /><ul><li><strong>Do</strong> – push people to get an app done and help them through the app store </li><li><strong>Do</strong> – provide guidance around how to build-in quality </li><li><strong>Do</strong> – provide some metrics that will help the app succeed in the end (design, best practices, possibly even saying, “That’s been done”) </li><li><strong>Do</strong> – recommend they cancel submitting their application if it hasn’t met the developers quality metric. (This isn’t going to save the app store, but would help to reduce the number of write-once-let-die-in-the-store apps) </li><li><strong>Don't – </strong>offer a prize for "the most apps submitted" within 24 hours. </li></ul>I’ve developed on the Microsoft platform for a long time and really hope there is a place for the Microsoft App Store in the future, but with their push for a large number of apps they’re not setting themselves up for an easy road back in the game.</div>
