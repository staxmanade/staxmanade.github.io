<div class="entry-content"><p>One of the biggest pain points I've run into while building an application with Facebook's <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is when you goof something up and you get an error in one of the React component lifecycle methods such as <code>render</code>, <code>componentWillMount</code>, <code>componentDidUpdate</code>, etc. The biggest problem is the lack of a <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2016/01/habit-of-a-solid-developer-rapid-feedback/">feedback loop</a> because React is swallowing exceptions, so you don't see the reported error in your developer console or any global error handlers called. There's even a chance you don't know something is going wrong (yet).</p>
<p>If I google for <code>react try catch</code> the first search result hit landed me on this <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2461">GitHub issue on error boundaries</a> (status: <code>open</code> as of this writing). There is a pull-request with what looks to be a potential work around, but until this lands and it provides enough of a solution I hope the below can help you.</p>
<p>If you read the comments of this post you'll see <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2461#issuecomment-114155631">this helpful comment</a> where Skiano links to a <a href="https://github.com/skiano/react-safe-render/blob/feature/safe-methods/index.js">github repo</a> with a pretty good wrapper that re-writes React components so the lifecycle methods get a useful <code>try/catch</code> and can properly log errors.</p>
<p>I liked the approach provided above but since I'm working on a project that is using <a href="https://babeljs.io">BabelJS</a> and <code>ES6/7</code>, I wanted to see if I could try using the new <a href="https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators">ES7 Decorators</a> which Babel supports to allow tagging certain ES6 React classes with this try/catch wrapper.</p>
<p>Below is what it looks like if you end up using it.</p>
<h1>Usage with an es7 @decorator</h1>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-literal">import</span> React from <span class="hljs-string">'react'</span>;
<span class="hljs-literal">import</span> wrapReactLifecycleMethodsWithTryCatch from <span class="hljs-string">'react-component-errors'</span>

<span class="hljs-annotation">@wrapReactLifecycleMethodsWithTryCatch</span>
<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">MyComponent</span> : <span class="hljs-title">React</span>.<span class="hljs-title">Component</span> </span>{
  componentDidMount(){
    <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Error(<span class="hljs-string">"Test error"</span>);
  }
  render(){
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> &lt;div&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>But you can also use this without the decorator pattern just by passing the class through the wrapper function.</p>
<h1>Usage without a decorator</h1>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> wrapReactComponentMethodsWithTryCatch from `react-log-errors.js`

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> MyComponent = React.createClass({
  componentDidMount: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
      <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Error(<span class="hljs-string">"Test error"</span>);
  },
  render: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> &lt;div&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;;
  }
});

wrapReactComponentMethodsWithTryCatch(MyComponent);
</code></pre>
<h1>How to get it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>NPM: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-component-errors">react-component-errors</a></li>
<li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/react-component-errors">staxmanade/react-component-errors</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>NOT tested for performance...</h1>
<p>FYI: this is primarily built as a development tool and has not been performance tested. While I haven't noticed any performance issues - I wouldn't recommend sending to production as is without a deeper impact analysis.</p>
<p>Happy React Debugging!</p>

<p>Find your feedback loop and then try to find ways to increase it's it's ability to report feedback sooner.</p>
<p>Feedback can come in many ways, and no matter what that feedback loop is, finding ways to increase it's ability to get you feedback sooner is generally going to help you in the long run.</p>
<p>If you think of a typical software development lifecycle, you can find ways to improve feedback loops in nearly all levels of the process. In a aesign phase, reviewing designs with the client/steakholder is one way to get feedback. During development you can get feedback from your unit tests or compiler or even your editors, when you manually review changes made in the application, or especially code reviews with other developers. QA's main purpose is to create a solid feedback loop about quality and while it's generally a slower feedback loop than other forms feedback it is extremly important and should generally not be overlooked or ignored. Once the app is in the wild, customers give feedback and you're applications can report various types of feedback such as crashes or customer sign-up numbers.</p>
<p>You've likely heard of the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast">Failing Fast</a> (if not, you should). In the end, failing fast is a great a type of feedback.</p>
<p>Try pair programming, having a partner watch for and point out silly mistakes, or propose alternative approaches. The instant feedback is hugely beneficial. Leverage the feedback of other tools such as a compiler, unit tests, or manual testing.</p>
<p>When working with a new code library or dependency, don't make assumptions about how something works, even though the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least astonishment</a> is nice to follow, don't assume that's how it works. Prove it, test it, fail fast or gather feedback on the exercise.</p>
<p>Test assumptions and prove to yourself that the assumptions are either right or wrong. This could come down to how you expect a library function to behave for certain inputs, or this could apply to how you <strong>think</strong> the customer wanted you to implement a feature.</p>
<p>Don't wait till the product is shipped to learn that's not what your customer asked for, try and find out ways to get that feedback sooner. Send it to some early adopters or beta users.</p>
<p>No matter what area of the process you work in or with, take a step back and look at your current feedback loops, how can you inject new feedback loops or improve the speed at which existing feedback loops can reach you. Can you turn a nightly build into an hourly build or check-in build (or auto-build on file save)? Of course too much feedback can get overwhelming, so take the ones that provide the most value to you and your process and find ways to optimize them.</p>
<p>Happy Feedback!</p>

<p>One of the best investments I made into my own education in the software development field was when I convinced my boss to purchase an mp3 player (It was <a href="http://amzn.to/1FLNZGO">a Zune back in the day</a> and was perfect for the job).</p>
<p>My company didn't seem to mind spending several thousand once a year to send me to a developer conference, but in comparison, a cheap purchase of a music player that I could sync Podcasts to was the best investment my employer could have made. With almost 1.5 hours commuting in the car round-trip, I was able to soak up a large amount of technology related information each and every day. My co-workers were always wondering where and how I would coming up with the knowledge about frameworks, tools, designs and other ideas.</p>
<h1>Equipment Needed</h1>
<p>You can likely go fancy with equipment, but I keep it pretty simple. Player and <a href="http://amzn.to/1HkxC4R">earbud headphones</a>.</p>
<h3>A podcast player</h3>
<p>Since everyone is different and how they want to consume podcast often varies, I'm not going to spend time recommending hardware/apps. If you have a smartphone, you already have a great podcast player in your pocket. Just take some time and look at 3rd party podcast player apps that are in your phone's app store. If you don't have a smartphone, there are <a href="http://amzn.to/1Hky570">lots of options</a> from just about anywhere. I use my iPhone since it's always with me and I can use the <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8&amp;at=10lPYJ">Downcast</a> app which has some great features that done't come with the standard iTunes podcast player.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Side note: I'm currently <a href="http://staxmanade.com/apps/xbox-one-podcast/development/">building a podcast player</a> with the intent of launching on Xbox One. If you have any interest come check it out...</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Some earbud headphones</h3>
<p>With as much listening as I do, I've found having several pairs of <a href="http://amzn.to/1HkxC4R">earbud headphones</a> lying around to be ideal. I can use birthday's or xmas as a time to request new ones. You can get a pair with mic control for under $10 and can be found in many stores which makes a cheap easy gift for others to pick up for you.</p>
<p>I like to keep a couple extra pairs in the house. Sometimes I forget and one goes through the wash. They often survey the wash/dryer cycle, but when they go out it's handy to have a backup pair.</p>
<p>The earbud works well for me since I can place one in and leave the other ear open to casually listening for moments like kids or wife calling for me.</p>
<p>Be sure to pick a pair that has the mic control. There is a button on there that can be used to control the play/pause of what you're listening to. This is handy because I can setup a podcast to play, place the phone in my pocket, stick an earbud in on ear and go about my task while listening to a podcast. With the mic button if my wife wants to talk to me it's a simple click to pause the show. If you haven't given this a try, I recommend it.</p>
<h1>Choosing Podcasts</h1>
<p>There are lots of ways to decide what podcasts to listen to, but here are some approaches I find useful.</p>
<p>When I don't know what's out there on a subject, I like to browse iTunes for a search term, select a few in the area of interest, download a couple shows and give them a listen.</p>
<p>While listening to podcasts, I pay attention to other shows that are mentioned or recommended. If I like the one I'm currently listening to and they suggest I check out another podcast there's a good chance I'll like it as well.</p>
<p>Don't feel like you have to commit to the podcast, if you listen to a few shows and you don't like the format or topics discussed, don't listen to it. Unsubscribe from the ones that don't add a ton of value to either you're education or entertainment setting. I find it is also a good idea to delete episodes on topics you have no interest in, or skip ones if they're not keeping your attention.</p>
<p>There is so much good content out there that you should never feel you need to listen to something that isn't going to keep your interest.</p>
<h1>When to listen.</h1>
<p>I no longer commute 1.X hours a day since I started <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2014/12/thoughts-on-working-remotely-from-home/">working remotely</a>, but that doesn't mean I don't have time to listen to podcasts. In fact, the number of podcasts that I subscribe to (and listen to) has actually gone up since my commuter days.</p>
<h3>Time/places to consume the content.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Obviously commuting to work is a great place to listen to podcasts. Put down the crappy celebrity gossip ridden talk radio (unless you're into that sort of thing) and soak up some higher quality informative podcasts.</li>
<li>Household chores is a great time to listen. Distention got podcasts while folding laundry or putting away dishes really helps with the mundane tasks.</li>
<li>Driving to pick up kids or after dropping them off. This was funny to me, on an episode of <a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-240-podcasts-for-startup-founders">Startups for the rest of us</a> Rob said:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>And the one other thing I do is, let’s say I’m going to go travel, from the <strong>time that I step in my car and leave my house</strong>, I have an earbud in. So I drive to the airport with an earbud in. I get out, I check in, I go through security, all with an earbud in. I wait and I get on the plane, and on the plane, maybe I’ll watch a movie, but if I’m going to try to sleep, typically I’ll listen to podcast. So there is like hours on both ends of a flight as an example. I can churn through 30 podcast episodes as long as I delete some, I’ll skip a few or I’ll skip around, that kind of stuff. I also have an earbud in when I’m making breakfast in the morning. I have one when I’m making dinner in the evening, when I’m doing dishes, when I’m out doing yard work, when I’m taking out the trash. Like most of my off time, when I’m not with my kids and when I’m kind of doing manual tasks. Even if it’s like five minutes of manual tasks, I can crank through stuff. So that’s kind of my process. How about you? - See more at: <a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-240-podcasts-for-startup-founders#sthash.RMZtrseu.dpuf">http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-240-podcasts-for-startup-founders#sthash.RMZtrseu.dpuf</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Ramp up the playback speed</h1>
<p>Most good podcast players have the ability to adjust the rate of playback while listening to the audio. Don't remember my old Zune having 1.5X playback speed, but oh man, once I discovered 1.5x playback speed on my <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8&amp;at=10lPYJ">Downcast</a> app it's crazy how much content I can zip through (and still enjoy) at the faster rate.</p>
<p>It may take some getting used to the higher speeds but for me, 1.5X is just about right. I'd like to try more 1.75x but Downcast doesn't support it - it jumps up to 2X. When I try listening to 2x speed it requires I focus hard to understand what's going on and is much less of a enjoyable listening experience. I'm thinking I can get there if I train my brain to listen to it...</p>
<h1>Listening to developer related podcasts</h1>
<p>Keeping up on developer focused podcasts was where I got my start with podcasts and are still the core of my listening genre. Hearing about certain technologies multiple times on different podcasts may be just enough for me to start digging into the technology myself.</p>
<p>While I mentioned above about deleting podcasts that I have no interest in, I do enjoy the surprise episode of some technology I didn't think I'd be interested in that opens up my eyes to something I hadn't known before. Even though it may turn out I never use sed technology, at least knowing a little about it can be beneficial if I have to apply it to a problem set in the future. This way I have at least been introduced to the idea and can research it further if need be.</p>
<h1>Subscribe to other subjects</h1>
<p>If you start to become an <a href="http://staxmanade.com/about/podcasts">oversumer of podcasts like myself</a>, that's OK. Just make sure you're not consuming the same style of podcasts (in my case only development related). Try to diversify your subscriptions. While I really enjoy all my developer related podcasts and they are still core to much of my listening habits, some of my favorite podcast have nothing to do with software development. Give a look at <a href="http://staxmanade.com/about/podcasts">some that I follow</a>, ask what others are listening to, and have fun exploring all the great content that is out there.</p>
<p>Happy Listening &amp; Learning!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>A JavaScript project I'm working on recently underwent a pretty good refactor. Many of the modules/methods in the application worked in a synchronous fashion which meant their unit tests were also generally synchronous. This was great because synchronous code is pretty much always easier to test since they're simpler and easier to reason about.</p>
<p>However, even though I new early on that I would likely have to turn a good number of my synchronous methods into asynchronous ones I tried holding off on that as long as absolutely necessary. I was in a mode of prototyping as much of the application out as possible before I wanted to be worried/thinking about asynchronous aspects of the code base.</p>
<p>Part of why I held of on this was because I was pretty confident using the new proposed ES7 <code>async/await</code> syntax to turn the sync code into async code relatively easily. While there were a few bumps along the refactor it actually went extremely well.</p>
<p>An example of one bump I ran into included replacing <code>items.forEach(item =&gt; item.doSomethingNowThatWillBecomeAsyncSoon())</code> with something that worked asynchronously and I found <a href="http://pouchdb.com/2015/03/05/taming-the-async-beast-with-es7.html">this blog post</a> immensely helpful. Basically, don't try to await a <code>forEach</code> instead build a list of promises you can await.</p>
<p>Another one I ran into was dealing with async mocha tests, which is what the rest of this post is about.</p>
<p><a href="https://mochajs.org">MochaJS</a> is great because the asynchronous testing has been there from the beginning. If you've <code>done</code> (see what I did there?) any asynchronous testing with MochaJS then you already know that you can signal to Mocha an asynchronous test is <code>done</code> by calling the test's async callback method.</p>
<p>Before we look at how to test asynchronous Mocha tests leveraging the new ES 7 async/await syntax, let's first take a little journey through some of the various asynchronous testing options with Mocha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: you will see example unit tests that use the <code>expect(...).to.equal(...)</code> style assertions from <a href="http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/">ChaiJS</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>How to create an asynchronous MochaJS test?</h1>
<p>If you look at a normal synchronous test:</p>
<pre><code>it(<span class="hljs-string">"should work"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span>{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">"Synchronous test"</span>);
});
</code></pre>
<p>all we have to do to turn it into an asynchronous test is to add a callback function as the first parameter in the mocha test function (I like to call it <code>done</code>) like this</p>
<pre><code>it(<span class="hljs-string">"should work"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">done</span>)</span>{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">"Synchronous test"</span>);
});
</code></pre>
<p>But that's an invalid asynchronous test.</p>
<h1>Invalid basic async mocha test</h1>
<p>This first async example test we shows is invalid because the <code>done</code> callback is never called. Here's another example using <code>setTimeout</code> to simulate proper asynchronicity. This will show up in Mocha as a timeout error because we never signal back to mocha by calling our <code>done</code> method.</p>
<pre><code>it(<span class="hljs-string">"where we forget the done() callback!"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">done</span>)</span>{
    setTimeout(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
        <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">"Test"</span>);
    }, <span class="hljs-number">200</span>);
});
</code></pre>
<h1>Valid basic async mocha test</h1>
<p>When we call the <code>done</code> method it tells Mocha the asynchronous work/test is complete.</p>
<pre><code>it<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-string">"Using setTimeout to simulate asynchronous code!"</span>, function<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">done</span>)</span>{
    setTimeout<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-list">()</span> {
        done<span class="hljs-list">()</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    }, <span class="hljs-number">200</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
})</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>
<h1>Valid basic async mocha test (that fails)</h1>
<p>With asynchronous tests the way we tell Mocha the test failed is by passing an <code>Error</code> or <code>string</code> to the <code>done(...)</code> callback</p>
<pre><code>it<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-string">"Using setTimeout to simulate asynchronous code!"</span>, function<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">done</span>)</span>{
    setTimeout<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-list">()</span> {
        done<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Error<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-string">"This is a sample failing async test"</span>)</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    }, <span class="hljs-number">200</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
})</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>
<h1>Invalid async with Promise mocha test</h1>
<p>If you were to run the below test it would fail with a timeout error.</p>
<pre><code>it(<span class="hljs-string">"Using a Promise that resolves successfully!"</span>, function(done) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> testPromise = new <span class="hljs-type">Promise</span>(function(resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            resolve(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello!"</span>);
        }, <span class="hljs-number">200</span>);
    });

    testPromise.then(function(<span class="hljs-literal">result</span>) {
        expect(<span class="hljs-literal">result</span>).to.equal(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello World!"</span>);
        done();
    }, done);
});
</code></pre>
<p>If you were to open up your developer tools you may notice an error printed to the console:</p>
<pre><code>    <span class="hljs-tag">Uncaught</span> (in promise) <span class="hljs-tag">i</span> {<span class="hljs-attribute">message</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"expected 'Hello!' to equal 'Hello World!'"</span>, <span class="hljs-attribute">showDiff</span>: true, <span class="hljs-attribute">actual</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Hello!"</span>, <span class="hljs-attribute">expected</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Hello World!"</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>The problem here is the <code>expect(result).to.equal(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);</code> above will fail before we can signal to Mocha via the <code>done()</code> of either an error or a completion which causes a timeout.</p>
<p>We can update the above test with a <code>try/catch</code> around our expectations that could throw exceptions so that we can report any errors to Mocha if they happened.</p>
<pre><code>it<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-string">"Using a Promise that resolves successfully with wrong expectation!"</span>, function<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">done</span>)</span> {
    var testPromise = new Promise<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">resolve</span>, reject)</span> {
        setTimeout<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-list">()</span> {
            resolve<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello World!"</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        }, <span class="hljs-number">200</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    })</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

    testPromise.then<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">result</span>)</span>{
        try {
            expect<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">result</span>)</span>.to.equal<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello!"</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
            done<span class="hljs-list">()</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        } catch<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">err</span>)</span> {
            done<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">err</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        }
    }, done)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
})</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This will correctly report the error in the test.</p>
<h1>Turn what we know above into async/await.</h1>
<p>Now that we know there are some special things we need to do in our async mocha tests (<code>done</code> callbacks and <code>try/catch</code> around code that throws assertions), let's see what happens if we start to use the new ES7 async/await syntax in the language and if it can enable more readable asynchronous unit tests.</p>
<p>The beauty of the async/await syntax is we get to reduce the <code>.then(callback, done)</code>... mumbo jumbo and turn that into code that reads like it were happening synchronously. The downside of this approach is that it's not happening synchronously and we can't forget that when we're looking at code and starting to use it this way. But overall it is generally easier to reason about in this style.</p>
<p>The big changes from the above <code>Promise</code> style test and the transformed <code>async</code> test below are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the <code>async</code> word in front of the <code>async function(done){...</code>. This tells the system that inside of this function there may (or may not be) the use of the <code>await</code> keyword and in the end the function is turned into a <code>Promise</code> under the hood.</li>
<li>We remove the <code>.then(function(result){</code> promise work and in place use the <code>await</code> keyword to have it return the promise value assign it to <code>result</code> so after that we can run our expectations against it.</li>
<li>Notice we still have to call <code>done</code> because this is still an asynchronous test so we have to tell Mocha when it's done (even though it almost looks synchronous).</li>
</ol>
<p>If we look below, we see that we flatten out the callback promise work which can get difficult to read and follow over time. But before we get too excited there's one problem with how I converted this method. What happens if the <code>testPromise</code> were to reject? (where did that reject handling code go?).</p>
<pre><code>it(<span class="hljs-string">"Using a Promise with async/await that resolves successfully with wrong expectation!"</span>, async function(done) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> testPromise = new <span class="hljs-type">Promise</span>(function(resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            resolve(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello World!"</span>);
        }, <span class="hljs-number">200</span>);
    });

    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-literal">result</span> = await testPromise;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> {
        expect(<span class="hljs-literal">result</span>).to.equal(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello!"</span>);
        done();
    } catch(err) {
        done(err);
    }
});
</code></pre>
<h1>Handling errors with <code>async/await</code></h1>
<p>One interesting implementation detail around async await is that exceptions and errors are handled just like you were to handle them in synchronous code using a <code>try/catch</code>.</p>
<p>So in the above test if the <code>testPromise</code> were to have <code>rejected</code> the promise or raised another type of exception we would not have seen the error in our mocha test and would have once again run into a timeout error.</p>
<p>The fix is to move the <code>try {</code> up above the <code>await testPromise;</code> so that any rejections form the asynchronous code OR errors thrown by our assertion library are caught and we can report them to Mocha.</p>
<p>Below shows the fixed (failing) but more properly setup async/await mocha unit test.</p>
<pre><code>it(<span class="hljs-string">"Using a Promise with async/await that resolves successfully with wrong expectation!"</span>, async function(done) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> testPromise = new <span class="hljs-type">Promise</span>(function(resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            resolve(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello World!"</span>);
        }, <span class="hljs-number">200</span>);
    });

    <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-literal">result</span> = await testPromise;

        expect(<span class="hljs-literal">result</span>).to.equal(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello!"</span>);

        done();
    } catch(err) {
        done(err);
    }
});
</code></pre>
<h1>Removing the test boilerplate</h1>
<p>One I started seeing the pattern and use of <code>try/catch</code> boilerplate showing up in my async tests, it became apparent that there had to be a more terse approach that could help me avoid forgetting the <code>try/catch</code> needed in each async test. This was because I would often remember the <code>async/await</code> syntax changes for my async tests but would often forget the <code>try/catch</code> which often resulted in timeout errors instead of proper failures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>another example below with the async/await and try/catch</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>it(<span class="hljs-string">"Using an async method with async/await!"</span>, async function(done) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-literal">result</span> = await somethingAsync();

        expect(<span class="hljs-literal">result</span>).to.equal(something);

        done();
    } catch(err) {
        done(err);
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>So I refactored that to reduce the friction.</p>
<h2>And the mochaAsync higher order function was born</h2>
<p>This simple little guy takes an <code>async</code> function which looks like <code>async () =&gt; {...}</code>. It then returns a higher order function which is also asynchronous but has wrapped your test function in a try/catch and also takes care of calling the mocha <code>done</code> in the proper place (either after your test is asynchronously completed, or errors out).</p>
<pre><code>var mochaAsync = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(fn)</span> =&gt;</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> async (done) =&gt; {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> {
            await fn();
            done();
        } <span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span> (err) {
            done(err);
        }
    };
};
</code></pre>
<p>You can use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>it<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-string">"Sample async/await mocha test using wrapper"</span>, mochaAsync<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-list">()</span> =&gt; {
    var x = await someAsyncMethodToTest<span class="hljs-list">()</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
    expect<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">x</span>)</span>.to.equal<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
})</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It can also be used with the mocha <code>before</code>, <code>beforeEach</code>, <code>after</code>, <code>afterEach</code> setup/teardown methods.</p>
<pre><code>beforeEach<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">mochaAsync</span><span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-list">()</span> =&gt; {
    await someLongSetupCode<span class="hljs-list">()</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
})</span>)</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>
<h1>In closing.</h1>
<p>This post may have seemed like quite a journey to get to the little poorly named <code>mochaAsync</code> helper but I hope it was helpful and I can't wait for the <code>async/await</code> syntax to become mainstream in JavaScript, but until then I'm thankful we have transpiring tools like <a href="http://babeljs.io">Babel</a> so we can take advantage of these features now. Especially in our tests...</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>

<p>Have you ever made some code changes and while in the process of making those changes realize you need to change something else, which leads to changes to that thing over there and then again up there, and down here, and over there and since we're in here and I've been meaning to tweak this well... and paused to realize you forgot the original goal of why you are even looking at this module of code? No never? (well I have). <code>git reset --hard</code> and start over :)</p>
<p>If you're one who likes to apply the ol Boy Scout rule of <code>Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it</code> to your code, just don't, at lest not yet. While I'm a big fan of cleaning up those legacy areas of code that just need a good sweep up, the approach taken here needs to be handled with care. I'm also referring to code that is likely covered well with automated testing.</p>
<h1>But Why?</h1>
<p>Before you go around making a bunch of cleanup changes, fixing formatting, changing variable names, general cleanup. Accomplish a tiny part of your overall objective and commit just that change.</p>
<p>If you see other things along the way, take note and come back to them later. Or if, like me you can't help yourself, just don't check all of those changes in at once. Use something like <code>git add -p</code> to <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2014/02/segregate-your-code-commits-into-tiny/">segregate your code commits into tiny topical changes</a>.</p>
<p>If the job is to <code>rename a variable</code>, don't also <code>fix spelling, format code, extract method, etc...</code>. Save those other changes for different commits.</p>
<h3>But what if you don't know what you're planning to change?</h3>
<p>Sometimes, it's good to go off and spike a big swath of changes just to get an idea how much impact a refactor could have on the architecture or project as a whole. Prototype something to get a good picture of whether a change is possible or not or to see how many coupled items need to be adjusted along the way.</p>
<p>However, you go into it knowing you will likely just undo all of your changes all together with the goal to surface more knowledgeable and either:</p>
<p>A) determine that it is a do-able change and should or should not even be attempted in a proper fashion
B) or you've uncovered some challenges that are not easily overcome and require more thought or prior preparatory refactorings.</p>
<h1>Use TDD as a forcing mechanism to small changes</h1>
<p>TDD (Test Driven Development) is a great way to take as tiny a step as possible. With this approach, you can write a test, make it pass (consider that a change) and <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2014/02/segregate-your-code-commits-into-tiny/">possibly check it in</a> to source control. One test at a time ensures that you're taking baby steps along the way to solving the bigger problem(s).</p>
<h1>Baby Steps also when Debugging</h1>
<p>Taking baby steps is also important when debugging. Running around the codebase changing X, Y, and Z just to see if you can fix a bug will often times get you in a bigger mess than the original bug you tried to fix. Making one change at a time, verifying the bug, then the next change is quite often a better approach. So consider going slow and taking baby steps.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you're making project-wide architectural changes or surgical bug fixes, if you can, <strong>try to take baby steps, commit the changes and verify each change along the way</strong>. It may feel like you're going slower, but in the long haul you may actually save time.</p>
<p>Happy Baby Steps!</p>

<p>I don't want to point to any specific audio example since I'd feel bad if some poor soul's hosted mp3 file gets hammered (not likely) because of this example. But you just need a link to a simple, short <code>mp3</code> (or whatever audio type you're trying to test). If you look at the sample below replace <code>&lt;&lt;SampleAudioUrlHere&gt;&gt;</code> with the link to your test audio file.</p>
<h1>Won't fit in localStorage?</h1>
<p>If you're trying to save an audio file that's too large as a <code>Base64</code> encoded audio file will be larger than it's original size and we don't get very much space in <code>localStorage</code> then, ya you're using a file that's too large... Get something smaller or don't to this. Just sayin :P</p>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<ol>
<li>Use <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">fetch</a> api we can easily get at the <code>blob()</code></li>
<li>Run the <code>Blob</code> through the <code>FileReader</code></li>
<li>Which also handily turned it into a data url for us</li>
<li>The data url is just a base64 encoded string which is easy to save to <code>localStorage</code></li>
<li>Read the string back out of <code>localStorage</code></li>
<li>Set the audio's <code>src</code> attribute to the audio data url</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
<p>While I was prototyping this I was borrowing someone else short <code>mp3</code> file and to work around CORS (cross origin http request) I used the handy <code>https://crossorigin.me/&lt;&lt;SampleAudioUrlHere&gt;&gt;</code> service. This may be ok to do for a prototype, but you should't typically run your requests through this service. It's insecure and against pretty much all the different web religions.</p>
<h1>Show me the code</h1>
<p>This was just a quick <code>get-er-done</code> example. Lots of not-great-practices, but it demonstrates the possibility. Enjoy!</p>

    </p>
</header>
<div class="entry-content"><p>I've been playing with <a href="https://github.com/winjs/winjs">WinJS</a> a bit lately, specifically the <a href="https://github.com/winjs/react-winjs">React-WinJS</a> and wanted the native WinJS Navigation to play a little nicer with a web browser. The original/default environment for WinJS app is within a WinRT/Metro application where there is no &quot;url/address&quot; bar to be seen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My uneducated guess is that the WinJS team decided not to worry about how <code>WinJS.Navigation</code> would integrate with a normal browser's history as there doesn't appear to be native integration or documentation about how to do it so far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/winjs/winjs/issues/1532">asked the team</a> if they had plans to work on any integration options, but only asked that last night so don't expect to hear back from over the weekend.</p>
<h3>UPDATE: I got tired of updating this blog post with my bug fixes/iterations of the idea - so I've moved it over to GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/WinJSBrowserHistory">github.com/staxmanade/WinJSBrowserHistory</a>.</h3>
<p>So I spent a moment and prototyped one possible solution which works for this simple test using the browser's history api since I'm not looking to support browsers older than IE 10.</p>
<p>Ideally we could leverage WinJS controls without worrying about how to &quot;integrate&quot; the <code>WinJS.Navigation</code> with anything, but sadly some of the WinJS controls take a dependency on <code>WinJS.Navigation</code> (like the BackButton) so finding a way to play nice with this can be challenging.</p>
<p>If you want to get this prototype running yourself, you can:</p>
<ol>
<li>save both files below to a folder</li>
<li>start up a simple web server. (I like to use <a href="http://npmjs.com/package/nws">nws</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>This prototype is 2 files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>index.html</code> &lt;-- basic JSPM bootstrapping and configuration</li>
<li><code>app.jsx</code> &lt;-- my whole navigation app in here...</li>
</ul>
<h2>index.html</h2>
<p>Couple mentions on this bootstrapping code:</p>
<ol>
<li>I set the background style to black (since in <code>app.jsx</code> I'm using the WinJS dark css) - this avoids a flash from white to black when the page loads</li>
<li>This is using <a href="https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs">SystemJS</a> which makes it really easy to prototype and bootstrap dependencies like <a href="https://github.com/winjs/winjs">WinJS</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. Please don't deploy something like this to production - follow proper <a href="https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/blob/master/docs/production-workflows.md">JSPM production workflow procedures</a>...</li>
<li>The <code>map</code> section in the <code>System.config</code> defines a pointer to a fork of <code>react-winjs</code> I have that supports <code>React 0.14</code> (so if you find this in the future and need it, try to use the native <code>react-winjs</code> if they've merged in <a href="https://github.com/winjs/react-winjs/pull/33">my pull request</a> instead.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Next I'd like to see if I could leverage something like <a href="https://github.com/flatiron/director">flatiron/director</a> for routing and get it to play nice with <code>WinJS.Navigation</code> and if I do, I'll post it as well...</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>The number of things you can learn in this field is mind blowing. The rate at which change happens, frameworks come and go and the various levels of abstraction can be daunting at times.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much or little you know, there is always a new level of abstraction you can dive into and get a better understanding of what's going on. I love the example <a href="http://hanselman.com">Scott Hanselman</a> uses about this topic in <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PleaseLearnToThinkAboutAbstractions.aspx">Please Learn to Think about Abstractions</a>.</p>
<p>It is amazing how much you can accomplish without having a clue about what is going under your abstractions. But if you were to take a moment now and then to try to understand what those abstractions are hiding from you, it will likely open your eyes to a level of understanding and insight as to how to use the abstraction that you may likely not understand how you made it work without that deeper insight. The understanding may help you get just needed bit of performance improvement, or fault tolerance in your projects, or how to set things up to be more maintainable.</p>
<p>An example of this for me recently is while working at <a href="http://vertigo.com/">Vertigo</a> I have helped to ship a number of streaming video based products without having to know anything about some of the specifics of say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming">HLS</a>. On this recent project we were having issues with a live stream and it just so happened we could peek through an HTTP Debugger proxy at the raw streaming manifest. This was previously a scary place for me to dig in an try to understand. However, taking the time to understand various parts of the HLS Spec have not only made me appreciate what it takes to put together one of these live streams, but I have now become just that much stronger as a team member on a video related projects.</p>
<p>As the famous philosopher Dory once said:</p>

<p>Happy Digging!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>If you do any sort of test driven development, you've likely heard of the following steps</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Red</strong>: In this case means you write a test first and see the <code>red</code> (meaning failing test).</li>
<li><strong>Green</strong>: This is where you actually write a tiny bit of production code to see the red test from above go green and pass.</li>
<li><strong>Refactor</strong>: Now that you have a passing test (or suite of tests) you can presumably safely refactor and apply any common code cleanup practices to the code.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The importance of the Red step.</h1>
<p>I don't want to go in to each of these steps in detail today, but I did want to drill into the <code>Red</code> step by giving you a short little example that happened to me today.</p>
<p>If you are interested in a little more detail on the subject check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Red-Green-Refactor.html">http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Red-Green-Refactor.html</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html">http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you're new to any sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a>/anything-DD you may not quite get how important this first step is, but hopefully the rest of this post helps...</p>
<h1>Make sure it fails</h1>
<p>The Red step is one of the most important, but one that a new practitioner may skip out of laziness. It takes discipline to write the failing test, run it and verify that it fails. It is so easy to write the test code AND the production code together, run it and see it pass that skipping the red step is something even seasoned veterans in the field can fall prey to.</p>
<p>However, if you don't see the test fail, how do you know it will ever fail?</p>
<p>I can tell you on numerous occasions in the past where I have written both production code and test code together, run it see it pass, just in case - comment out the production code and STILL see the test pass. Wait what?</p>
<p>If you are not careful you may have created a bad test and if you run this Red step first and you don't see it turn Red, you likely have a problem.</p>
<p>It could be a problem with the test itself, or possibly something you put in the test that is triggering something deeper in the system. It doesn't matter what the problem is, you first need to get the test to turn red before you write any production code to make it turn green.</p>
<h1>Make sure it fails FOR THE RIGHT REASON</h1>
<p>While it's easy to see a red bar and move on, it's also good to review the exact reason it failed. Did you get a <code>FileNotFoundException</code> exception when you were expecting a <code>NullReferenceException</code>? Or did you get an integer value of <code>10</code> when you were thinking at that moment it would have failed because it returned a string?</p>
<p>If you're writing proper tests, your red step will include a true failure case that not only just fails, but fails for the reason you would expect it to fail - at least until you go to write the production code that satisfies the tests intent.</p>
<h1>Now a little example.</h1>
<p>In the example below I was behaving myself and I DID run the red step first. I am using plain-ish JavaScript (I say ish here because I'm using ES6 with babel compiler).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's much easier to make the type of mistake I'm going to highlight below with plain JavaScript than if you were using a statically typed language. You can try something like <a href="http://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> for <a href="http://flowtype.org/">flow</a> as these compilers provide a static type checker over your JavaScript. Compilers are a great first test...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas, I'm not doing that at the moment.</p>
<p>So here is what I did...</p>
<p>First I wrote a test:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> FeedData <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">'../app/feed.js'</span>;

describe(<span class="hljs-string">"feed cache"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{

  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> feedCache;

  before(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    feedCache = FeedData.loadCache();
  });

  it(<span class="hljs-string">"Feed Cache should have two items"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    expect(feedCache.length).to.equal(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
  });

});

</code></pre>
<p>When I tried to run it I got the error saying that <code>TypeError: FeedData.loadCache is not a function</code>. This was great and made total sense because I haven't written this <code>loadCache()</code> function yet.</p>
<p>Next I opened up my <code>FeedData.js</code> file and added the <code>loadCache()</code> function.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-literal">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">FeedData</span> </span>{
  loadCache() {

  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I left the implementation blank for now and re-ran my tests. Same error <code>TypeError: FeedData.loadCache is not a function</code> as above.</p>
<p>That was odd, because I know I added the function but apparently it didn't think I had... some scratching... looking... hmm... Ahh ha - I had imported from <code>feed.js</code> not <code>feedData.js</code>.</p>
<p>It's subtle, but in my app <code>feedData</code> and <code>feed</code> are different things. So I moved the function to the correct ES6 class and re-ran the tests. I was <strong>certain</strong> this time that it may fail but at least fail for the right reason (not a missing function).</p>
<p>ARGGG....</p>
<p>Again I got the same error <code>TypeError: FeedData.loadCache is not a function</code>. Ok, that was weird. Now I'm wondering if I have a caching problem in my browser, but before I try to debug Chrome's caching (kidding there, if I ever have to go that far I'm really having a rough day) I better have another look at my code.</p>
<p>It didn't take long in this case to realize where my issue was. <code>FeedData</code> is an ES6 class and I'm calling what I thought was a static function on the class from within the test, however it wasn't declared as static in the implementation.</p>
<p>Adding the <code>static</code> keyword below turned this function into what my test was originally expecting.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> FeedData {
  <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-title">loadCache</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, all this work just to get the first part of my <code>red</code> test. What a journey it's been for something as silly as declaring a function.</p>
<p>It was a good reminder just how important the red step in red, green, refactor is.</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>A while back I wrote about <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2015/03/in-app-unit-tests/">In App Unit Tests</a> and have been having too much fun creating little <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2015/09/jsmp-systemjs-starter-plunker/">starter plunks</a> on <a href="http://plnkr.co">Plunker</a>. So...</p>
<p>As a simple demonstration on in-app unit tests I've thrown together a little plunk that shows <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2015/03/in-app-unit-tests/">in-app tests</a> within the a <a href="https://github.com/winjs/winjs">WinJS</a> <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn624879.aspx">Pivot</a>. And add to the layers of abstraction I'm using <a href="https://github.com/winjs/react-winjs">react-winjs</a> which I'm LOVING over normal WinJS development.</p>
<h1>Link to: <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/feKPEx?p=preview">JSPM/React/WinJS/Mocha Plunk</a></h1>
<p>If you like this starter, I have it and a few more linked here: <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2015/09/jsmp-systemjs-starter-plunker/">for re-use</a></p>
<p>I'd like to highlight <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/feKPEx?p=preview">this particular starter</a> at bit more in this post, not only because there are a few more concepts to this basic plunk, but also because I'm fairly happy with the MochaJS React component that I've now copied around and re-used a few times in some small projects where use <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2015/03/in-app-unit-tests/">In App Unit Tests</a>.</p>
<h1>Plunker file overview</h1>
<ul>
<li><code>index.html</code> - The index file is a very basic <a href="http://jspm.io">JSPM</a> bootstrap page that loads the <code>app.jsx</code> react component.</li>
<li><code>app.jsx</code> - Defines a WinJS Pivot control where we render the in-app <code>MochaTests.jsx</code> React component. This also defines the test file(s) and using MochaJS's global detection we can tell the react <code>MochaTests</code> component what test files to load and run as well as what globals are allowed to exist.</li>
<li><code>config.js</code> - This is JSPM's config that defines what version of React we're using and to use <code>babel</code> for transpilation.</li>
<li><code>tests.js</code> - is our Mocha set of unit tests. We can have multiple test files if we want, just have to define what files to load in <code>app.jsx</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly the <code>MochaTests.jsx</code> which I'll include the full component below:</p>

<p>Usage example of this React <code>MochaTests</code> component.</p>
<pre><code>// <span class="hljs-type">Define</span> what test files get loaded by the <span class="hljs-type">MochaTests</span> component
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> testScripts = [
  './tests.js'
];


<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> allowedTestGlobals = [
  // <span class="hljs-type">Declare</span> what globals are allowed to be created during <span class="hljs-type">any</span> test runs.
];


// <span class="hljs-type">Usage</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-type">MochaTests</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> a react render() <span class="hljs-keyword">method</span>.
&lt;<span class="hljs-type">MochaTests</span> testScripts={testScripts} allowedGlobals={allowedTestGlobals} /&gt;

<p>I'm not expecting to see a large up-tick in WinJS apps out there with in-app unit tests that run in the browser, however hopefully the <code>MochaTests.jsx</code> React Component is of value to you and can be utilized outside of WinJS within almost any React app.</p>
<p>Please drop a line if you end up using it or if it can be adapted. If there's value in the component, maybe</p>
<h1>Known Issue</h1>
<p>If the number of tests starts to go beyond the height of the pivot in this sample, it has an issue where the WinJS Pivot cuts off at the bottom not allowing you to scroll and see the rest of the test output. I haven't dug into it yet because I've been clicking the <code>failures: X</code> link and it filters the U.I. to just the erroring tests.</p>
<p>If you happen to come up with a good solution, drop me a note - I'd love it. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>
