          I am in the midst of building a desperately missing app for Xbox One. A Podcast Listener (Podcatcher)
        </h2>

        <p>
          If you, like myself, felt like the Xbox One platform was missing an
          essential Podcast player app, then you have come to the right place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine how great it would be to listen to your favorite podcasts
          while you are also playing Xbox One games or apps, or in the background
          while you work out in your game room, do dishes in the kitchen or
          whatever else you do while you listen to your favorite podcasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted this app to exist as well - so I am embarking on the journey
          to build it. Now, if you would like to follow along during this journey,
          or participate by filling out surveys (they'll help determine what features
          make it in to the initial version), offering opinions or critiques during the
          development phase, then I would encourage you to sign up below and gain
          exclusive access to me (the developer) during the entire process.
        </p>

        Who am I?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Hi, my name is Jason. I am a father, husband,
        <a href="http://staxmanade.com/about">software developer</a> and
        a <a href="http://staxmanade.com/about/podcasts">huge fan of podcasts</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently acquired an Xbox One, where I found out quickly that I could not play <a href="http://staxmanade.com/about/podcasts/">my
        favorite podcasts</a> while I played <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I6E6SH6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00I6E6SH6&linkCode=as2&tag=staxmanadecom-20&linkId=KHXGKUXRI5FLAV2H">Minecraft</a>
        with my daughter. So, through some connections I have and my previous experience building Xbox One apps,
        I decided to jump on the opportunity to develop the application that I wanted to have.
      </p>

        How can you participate?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Since I am building this app as an independent developer, meaning I am doing this with my
        own time/money with what little free-time I have between a 'normal job' and raising a family,
        I would love the opportunity to share this development process with you as I go.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you sign up, you will be given the opportunity to provide valuable feedback in the feature
        development, prioritization and overall functionality of the Xbox One Podcast player.
      </p>
