<div class="entry-content"><p>I've been thinking about some of the software development related habits that I've practiced and acquired over the years. I thought putting some of these down in posts and sharing would both help me solidify my own thinking on the subjects, but also provide a good place to link other developers or anyone I would like to send a topic when the context justifies it.</p>
<p>For this first post, I'd like to highlight some older posts that fit well into this category:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://staxmanade.com/2012/01/you-are-responsible-for-making-that/">You are responsible for making that feature work. Write a test. Just do it…</a></li>
<li><a href="http://staxmanade.com/2014/02/segregate-your-code-commits-into-tiny/">Segregate your code commits into tiny topical changes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://staxmanade.com/2013/12/leave-yourself-breadcrumb-for-tomorrow/">Leave yourself a breadcrumb for tomorrow.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://staxmanade.com/2013/05/developer-humor/">Developer humor</a>
<ul>
<li>Not a practice - but good to take a step back and laugh a bit...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://staxmanade.com/2014/03/rake-psake-grunt-gulp-jake-make-cake/">rake, psake, grunt, gulp, jake, make, cake, brunch, ant, bash, maven, or fabric. as long as you putOnAHelmet</a></li>

</ul>
<p>In future posts I'm going to write down some of the habits that I think have helped me become a better developer over the years. While I get glimpses of (being the old guy) in a room of developers, I know that my learning is never done and my future has more personal growth than I can even imagine. Regardless, I hope you find these posts useful.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>Respond to emails with <strong>got it</strong>. Or some context-related reply, for example: <strong>thanks</strong> or <strong>will respond with further detail later...</strong></p>
<h1>More Context</h1>
<p>We all know that communication is important, and often where things go awry.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if I'm alone in this thinking, but don't think I am. When I send an important email, I like to know that the person on the other end received it. It may be an email that will take the other person time to respond with the detail necessary, but it's awfully unproductive to send an email, and wait  a day or two before finding out that the communication was never received.</p>
<p>Simply replying with <strong>got it</strong> or <strong>got it, will respond with more detail later...</strong> is a great way to notify me that you've received the email (and may take some time to respond).</p>
<p>I don't necessarily care that my email takes priority, but at least knowing that the other end has seen it is 1/2 the battle.</p>

<p>A standard task I began placing in my projects lately is one that easily integrates with my build tool of choice (rake, psake, etc&#8230;) and when run, installs a git pre-commit hook into my local copy of the repo that will run tests before code is committ. I&#8217;ve fancied calling the task <em><a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/PutOnAHelmet">putOnAHelmet</a></em>.</p> <p>Come checkout a small <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/PutOnAHelmet">little github repo </a> I started to keep track of various versions of this and feel free to open an issue or send a pull request with another one!</p> <p>I don&#8217;t want to get into details about pre-commit hooks and how you should author them in this post (maybe we can expand the language in the repo&#8217;s readme&#8230;). You can also check <a href="http://bit.ly/1bit9Pe">out other writings</a>&#8230; But one of the biggest problems I have with them is gits in-ability to easily keep track of pre-commit hooks much like it can with the rest of the projects source. </p> <p>Now it&#8217;s true that different people need the ability to customize these, but a general &#8220;running of tests&#8221; before committing is a great first step and I&#8217;ve found these set of tasks the easiest way to carry them from repo to repo.</p> <p>Hope others find this useful!</p> <p>Happy committing!</p></div>

<div class="entry-content"><p>If your not using source control for your coding projects, get off my lawn. :P (#JustHadToSayIt)</p>
<p>Now that I'm only reaching people who use source control (serious developers), I'd like to ask that you focus hard to only commit changes that belong to a single topic at a time. Think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">SRP</a> for code commits/check-ins.</p>
<h4>What is a topical commit?</h4>
<p>That almost looks like 'tropical' and wouldn't it be nice to be in a tropical place doing commits to your code, but I digress...</p>
<p>The topics I'm referring to are specific functional units of change where each tiny commit is related to a single topic or theme.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding feature X</li>
<li>refactoring</li>
<li>bug fix</li>
<li>spelling fix</li>
<li>Updating comments/documentation</li>
<li>*** code formatting ***</li>
</ul>
<p>I highlighted that last one for a reason as it's the impetus for writing this post.</p>
<h3>Don't mix topics/themes within a single commit!</h3>
<p>Instead break them into multiple commits. If you're using git, checkout '<a href="http://johnkary.net/blog/git-add-p-the-most-powerful-git-feature-youre-not-using-yet/">git add -p</a>'</p>
<p>If you have a one line bug fix but the file has 20 lines of code formatting changes (you know who you are). It makes determining what the bug fix is nearly impossible from the changes that are code formatting.</p>
<p>Using tools like git bisect to look at history become difficult. Pull Requests in GitHub become difficult to understand. If you've left a codebase for a while and come back, try reading changes that have happened over time to get caught up can be extremely difficult to do if your commits are not topically based.</p>
<p>Let's just NOT mix topics in our commits, ok?</p>
<p>K, THX bye!</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>

<p>Have you ever arrived at work and sat down, not exactly sure what you were working on the day before? You spend some time going through emails. Start looking at your codebase, maybe the last couple commits you made trying to get back into the mental groove you were in the day before.</p>  <p>There is a <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=get+back+into+programming+after+interruption" target="_blank">lot of information</a> about how long it takes to get back into the programming zone. <strong>If you leave yourself a breadcrumb or two, it is much easier to get started when you come back to your task.</strong></p>  <h3>Some of my favorite breadcrumbs.</h3>  <h4>Leave a failing unit test.</h4>  <p>If you practice any sort of test driven development, leaving a failing test to pick up the next day can be one of the most useful methods to get going again when you come back to the problem. If you’ve spent the time to think through the problem enough to write a failing unit test, this can help to ease you into the task at hand and get rolling the next day. </p>  <h4>Explicitly leave a note or compiler error in the code.</h4>  <p>Now, it’s probably common to check your working code in at the end of the day, but sometimes you just can’t work it to completion. That’s ok, and if you use a tool that supports something like this, leave yourself a breadcrumb of one or more compiler errors.</p>  <p>If I’m writing some C# I sometimes use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/x5hedts0.aspx" target="_blank">#error precompiler</a> directive with a helpful message.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-3BSP6C9ismg/UqFnBqT43GI/AAAAAAAAAiI/BvwY-gpVO-o/s1600-h/image3.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-XgX7jyzCT_c/UqFnCTtDw7I/AAAAAAAAAiQ/o5EgtBxl_vA/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800" width="531" height="177" /></a></p>  <p>This allows me to come in the next day. Hit build on the project and immediately see where I was in the codebase last and need to pick up again.</p>  <h4>Other, less specific, but useful options:</h4>  <ul>   <li>Send yourself an email describing what you’re working on and what still needs to be done. </li>    <li>Write in your favorite notes app. I like to use OneNote to keep track of my ‘scrum notes’ which help me describe what I did today and what I plan on doing tomorrow. </li>    <li>Sticky note? (can’t say I’ve used a pen/paper in a while – but if it works for you go for it)</li> </ul>  <p>It doesn’t have to be anything special, just a little note to yourself that can help you get a jump start on your next task at hand.</p>  <p>What other methods do you use to get back into the problem at hand?</p>  </div>

<p>Today the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_manager">PM</a> of a project I am working on sent an email with a small list of issues that we needed to get resolved before shipping an early build to the customer for a weekly review. In his list of issues MY NAME was tagged next to a feature that I KNOW was working. I dev’d it, tested, saw it work.</p>
<p>Now the project I’m working on encourages unit tested code, which is a fantastic project to be on since I am a big proponent of Unit/Integration/Automated tests. Heck I wrote a tool to help run them easier (<a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/">StatLight</a>).</p>
<h4>What I did.</h4>
<p>The problem was this. I dev’d a feature out in like 5 minutes, took about 2 seconds to decide if I should write a unit test to prove my feature worked and <b>this</b>
<b>
  <i>
  </i>
</b>
<b>is where I failed</b>. Manually verified my change checked in the production code without its test and I was hurriedly moved on to the next task.</p>
<p>About 20 min later I get a quick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">I.M.</a> from a co-worker saying he had a small merge conflict in the file I just checked-in. Quickly told him how to get around his merge issue (not realizing after he checked in) that my “quick 5min dev task” was accidently removed in the merge.</p>
<h4>What I SHOULD have done!</h4>
<p>What I<b> should </b>have done was write the <strong>2 lines of test code first</strong>. <i>(you can argue test after/test first, I prefer test-first)</i>. Proven my code wasn’t working, by running the test, and then implement the 5 min feature making the test pass. Then when my co-worker ran into his merge issue.</p>
<p>
  <img src="http://boldandfab.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/pow.jpg" width="179" height="126" />
</p>
<p>Test would have failed telling him his merge didn’t go as planned.</p>
<h4>This would have also avoided</h4>
<ul>
  <li>PM wouldn’t have had to discover the issue, Screenshot and write up an email. </li>
  <li>I wouldn’t have had to peruse source control history to understand why my “working” feature wasn’t working. </li>
  <li>I wouldn’t have had to willingly confess my sins in this post.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your feature doesn’t have a coinciding automated test. How do you know it’s still working?</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>
