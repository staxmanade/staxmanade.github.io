<p>Find your feedback loop and then try to find ways to increase it's it's ability to report feedback sooner.</p>
<p>Feedback can come in many ways, and no matter what that feedback loop is, finding ways to increase it's ability to get you feedback sooner is generally going to help you in the long run.</p>
<p>If you think of a typical software development lifecycle, you can find ways to improve feedback loops in nearly all levels of the process. In a aesign phase, reviewing designs with the client/steakholder is one way to get feedback. During development you can get feedback from your unit tests or compiler or even your editors, when you manually review changes made in the application, or especially code reviews with other developers. QA's main purpose is to create a solid feedback loop about quality and while it's generally a slower feedback loop than other forms feedback it is extremly important and should generally not be overlooked or ignored. Once the app is in the wild, customers give feedback and you're applications can report various types of feedback such as crashes or customer sign-up numbers.</p>
<p>You've likely heard of the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast">Failing Fast</a> (if not, you should). In the end, failing fast is a great a type of feedback.</p>
<p>Try pair programming, having a partner watch for and point out silly mistakes, or propose alternative approaches. The instant feedback is hugely beneficial. Leverage the feedback of other tools such as a compiler, unit tests, or manual testing.</p>
<p>When working with a new code library or dependency, don't make assumptions about how something works, even though the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least astonishment</a> is nice to follow, don't assume that's how it works. Prove it, test it, fail fast or gather feedback on the exercise.</p>
<p>Test assumptions and prove to yourself that the assumptions are either right or wrong. This could come down to how you expect a library function to behave for certain inputs, or this could apply to how you <strong>think</strong> the customer wanted you to implement a feature.</p>
<p>Don't wait till the product is shipped to learn that's not what your customer asked for, try and find out ways to get that feedback sooner. Send it to some early adopters or beta users.</p>
<p>No matter what area of the process you work in or with, take a step back and look at your current feedback loops, how can you inject new feedback loops or improve the speed at which existing feedback loops can reach you. Can you turn a nightly build into an hourly build or check-in build (or auto-build on file save)? Of course too much feedback can get overwhelming, so take the ones that provide the most value to you and your process and find ways to optimize them.</p>
<p>Happy Feedback!</p>

<p>One of the best investments I made into my own education in the software development field was when I convinced my boss to purchase an mp3 player (It was <a href="http://amzn.to/1FLNZGO">a Zune back in the day</a> and was perfect for the job).</p>
<p>My company didn't seem to mind spending several thousand once a year to send me to a developer conference, but in comparison, a cheap purchase of a music player that I could sync Podcasts to was the best investment my employer could have made. With almost 1.5 hours commuting in the car round-trip, I was able to soak up a large amount of technology related information each and every day. My co-workers were always wondering where and how I would come up with the knowledge about frameworks, tools, designs and other ideas.</p>
<h1>Equipment Needed</h1>
<p>You can likely go fancy with equipment, but I keep it pretty simple. Player and <a href="http://amzn.to/1HkxC4R">earbud headphones</a>.</p>
<h3>A podcast player</h3>
<p>Since everyone is different and how they want to consume podcast often varies, I'm not going to spend time recommending hardware/apps. If you have a smartphone, you already have a great podcast player in your pocket. Just take some time and look at 3rd party podcast player apps that are in your phone's app store. If you don't have a smartphone, there are <a href="http://amzn.to/1Hky570">lots of options</a> from just about anywhere. I use my iPhone since it's always with me and I can use the <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8&amp;at=10lPYJ">Downcast</a> app which has some great features that don't come with the standard iTunes podcast player.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Side note: I'm currently <a href="https://staxmanade.com/apps/xbox-one-podcast/development/">building a podcast player</a> with the intent of launching on Xbox One. If you have any interest, come check it out...</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Some earbud headphones</h3>
<p>Be sure to pick a pair of <a href="http://amzn.to/1HkxC4R">earbud headphones</a> that have the mic button control. There is a button on there that can be used to control the play/pause of what you're listening to. This is handy because I can setup a podcast to play, place the phone in my pocket, stick an earbud in an ear and go about my task while listening to a podcast. With the mic button if my wife wants to talk to me it's a simple click to pause the show. If you haven't given this a try, I recommend it.</p>
<h1>Choosing Podcasts</h1>
<p>There are lots of ways to decide what podcasts to listen to, but here are some approaches I find useful.</p>
<p>When I don't know what's out there on a subject, I like to browse iTunes for a search term, select a few in the area of interest, download a couple shows and give them a listen.</p>
<p>While listening to podcasts, I pay attention to other shows that are mentioned or recommended. If I like the one I'm currently listening to and they suggest I check out another podcast, there's a good chance I'll like it as well.</p>
<p>Don't feel like you have to commit to the podcast, if you listen to a few shows and you don't like the format or topics discussed, unsubscribe from the ones that don't add value to either you're education or entertainment setting. I find it is also a good idea to delete episodes on topics you have no interest in, or skip ones if they're not keeping your attention.</p>
<p>There is so much good content out there that you should never feel you need to listen to something that isn't going to keep your interest.</p>
<h1>When to listen.</h1>
<p>I no longer commute 1.X hours a day since I started <a href="https://staxmanade.com/2014/12/thoughts-on-working-remotely-from-home/">working remotely</a>, but that doesn't mean I don't have time to listen to podcasts. In fact, the number of podcasts that I subscribe to (and listen to) has actually gone up since my commuter days.</p>
<h3>Time/places to consume the content.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Obviously commuting to work is a great place to listen to podcasts. Put down the crappy celebrity gossip ridden talk radio (unless you're into that sort of thing) and soak up some higher quality informative podcasts.</li>
<li>Household chores is a great time to listen. Distention got podcasts while folding laundry or putting away dishes really helps with the mundane tasks.</li>
<li>Driving to pick up kids or after dropping them off. This was funny to me, on an episode of <a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-240-podcasts-for-startup-founders">Startups for the rest of us</a> Rob said:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>And the one other thing I do is, let’s say I’m going to go travel, from the <strong>time that I step in my car and leave my house</strong>, I have an earbud in. So I drive to the airport with an earbud in. I get out, I check in, I go through security, all with an earbud in. I wait and I get on the plane, and on the plane, maybe I’ll watch a movie, but if I’m going to try to sleep, typically I’ll listen to podcast. So there is like hours on both ends of a flight as an example. I can churn through 30 podcast episodes as long as I delete some, I’ll skip a few or I’ll skip around, that kind of stuff. I also have an earbud in when I’m making breakfast in the morning. I have one when I’m making dinner in the evening, when I’m doing dishes, when I’m out doing yard work, when I’m taking out the trash. Like most of my off time, when I’m not with my kids and when I’m kind of doing manual tasks. Even if it’s like five minutes of manual tasks, I can crank through stuff. So that’s kind of my process. How about you? - See more at: <a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-240-podcasts-for-startup-founders#sthash.RMZtrseu.dpuf">http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-240-podcasts-for-startup-founders#sthash.RMZtrseu.dpuf</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Ramp up the playback speed</h1>
<p>Most good podcast players have the ability to adjust the rate of playback while listening to the audio. Don't remember my old Zune having 1.5X playback speed, but oh man, once I discovered 1.5x playback speed on my <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8&amp;at=10lPYJ">Downcast</a> app it's crazy how much content I can zip through (and still enjoy) at the faster rate.</p>
<p>It may take some getting used to the higher speeds but for me, 1.5X is just about right. I'd like to try more 1.75x but Downcast doesn't support it - it jumps up to 2X. When I try listening to 2x speed I find it requires more focus to understand what's going on and is much less of a enjoyable listening experience. I'm thinking I can get there if I train my brain to listen to it...</p>
<h1>Listening to developer related podcasts</h1>
<p>Keeping up on developer focused podcasts was where I got my start with podcasts and are still the core of my listening genre. Hearing about certain technologies multiple times on different podcasts may be just enough for me to start digging into the technology myself.</p>
<p>While I mentioned above about deleting podcasts that I have no interest in, I do enjoy the surprise episode of some technology I didn't think I'd be interested in that opens my eyes to something I hadn't known before. Even though it may turn out I never use sed technology, at least knowing a little about it can be beneficial if I have to apply it to a problem set in the future. This way, I at least been introduced to the idea and can research it further should I feel the need.</p>
<h1>Subscribe to other subjects</h1>
<p>If you start to become an <a href="https://staxmanade.com/about/podcasts">oversumer of podcasts like myself</a>, that's OK. Just make sure you're not consuming the same style of podcasts (in my case only development related). Try to diversify your subscriptions. While I really enjoy all my developer related podcasts and they are still core to much of my listening habits, some of my favorite podcast have nothing to do with software development. Give a look at <a href="https://staxmanade.com/about/podcasts">some that I follow</a>, ask what others are listening to, and have fun exploring all the great content that is out there.</p>
<p>Happy Listening &amp; Learning!</p>

<p>Have you ever made some code changes and while in the process of making those changes realize you need to change something else, which leads to changes to that thing over there and then again up there, and down here, and over there and since we're in here and I've been meaning to tweak this well... and paused to realize you forgot the original goal of why you are even looking at this module of code? No never? (well I have). <code>git reset --hard</code> and start over :)</p>
<p>If you're one who likes to apply the ol Boy Scout rule of <code>Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it</code> to your code, just don't, at lest not yet. While I'm a big fan of cleaning up those legacy areas of code that just need a good sweep up, the approach taken here needs to be handled with care. I'm also referring to code that is likely covered well with automated testing.</p>
<h1>But Why?</h1>
<p>Before you go around making a bunch of cleanup changes, fixing formatting, changing variable names, general cleanup. Accomplish a tiny part of your overall objective and commit just that change.</p>
<p>If you see other things along the way, take note and come back to them later. Or if, like me you can't help yourself, just don't check all of those changes in at once. Use something like <code>git add -p</code> to <a href="https://staxmanade.com/2014/02/segregate-your-code-commits-into-tiny/">segregate your code commits into tiny topical changes</a>.</p>
<p>If the job is to <code>rename a variable</code>, don't also <code>fix spelling, format code, extract method, etc...</code>. Save those other changes for different commits.</p>
<h3>But what if you don't know what you're planning to change?</h3>
<p>Sometimes, it's good to go off and spike a big swath of changes just to get an idea how much impact a refactor could have on the architecture or project as a whole. Prototype something to get a good picture of whether a change is possible or not or to see how many coupled items need to be adjusted along the way.</p>
<p>However, you go into it knowing you will likely just undo all of your changes all together with the goal to surface more knowledgeable and either:</p>
<p>A) determine that it is a do-able change and should or should not even be attempted in a proper fashion
B) or you've uncovered some challenges that are not easily overcome and require more thought or prior preparatory refactorings.</p>
<h1>Use TDD as a forcing mechanism to small changes</h1>
<p>TDD (Test Driven Development) is a great way to take as tiny a step as possible. With this approach, you can write a test, make it pass (consider that a change) and <a href="https://staxmanade.com/2014/02/segregate-your-code-commits-into-tiny/">possibly check it in</a> to source control. One test at a time ensures that you're taking baby steps along the way to solving the bigger problem(s).</p>
<h1>Baby Steps also when Debugging</h1>
<p>Taking baby steps is also important when debugging. Running around the codebase changing X, Y, and Z just to see if you can fix a bug will often times get you in a bigger mess than the original bug you tried to fix. Making one change at a time, verifying the bug, then the next change is quite often a better approach. So consider going slow and taking baby steps.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you're making project-wide architectural changes or surgical bug fixes, if you can, <strong>try to take baby steps, commit the changes and verify each change along the way</strong>. It may feel like you're going slower, but in the long haul you may actually save time.</p>
<p>Happy Baby Steps!</p>

<p>The number of things you can learn in this field is mind blowing. The rate at which change happens, frameworks come and go and the various levels of abstraction can be daunting at times.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much or little you know, there is always a new level of abstraction you can dive into and get a better understanding of what's going on. I love the example <a href="http://hanselman.com">Scott Hanselman</a> uses about this topic in <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PleaseLearnToThinkAboutAbstractions.aspx">Please Learn to Think about Abstractions</a>.</p>
<p>It is amazing how much you can accomplish without having a clue about what is going under your abstractions. But if you were to take a moment now and then to try to understand what those abstractions are hiding from you, it will likely open your eyes to a level of understanding and insight as to how to use the abstraction that you may likely not understand how you made it work without that deeper insight. The understanding may help you get just needed bit of performance improvement, or fault tolerance in your projects, or how to set things up to be more maintainable.</p>
<p>An example of this for me recently is while working at <a href="http://vertigo.com/">Vertigo</a> I have helped to ship a number of streaming video based products without having to know anything about some of the specifics of say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming">HLS</a>. On this recent project we were having issues with a live stream and it just so happened we could peek through an HTTP Debugger proxy at the raw streaming manifest. This was previously a scary place for me to dig in an try to understand. However, taking the time to understand various parts of the HLS Spec have not only made me appreciate what it takes to put together one of these live streams, but I have now become just that much stronger as a team member on a video related projects.</p>
<p>As the famous philosopher Dory once said:</p>

<p>While I generally sit on the side of the fence that your code should <strong>read clearly</strong> enough that comments should not be necessary. I concede that there are (often) times when a comment can really help to make the job of understanding the code much easier than just how a variable or method is named or organized.</p>
<p>One example of such case is when you've gotten lost in the code and don't understand how a piece of it works.</p>
<p>The second you figure or re-discover it's intent, <strong>try to add or update some comments</strong> in the code that may help you or the next person understand it more clearly in the future.</p>
<p>You can argue that a comment should have been added initially, but life happens and we don't always save little nuances like we should or we're given a codebase that is not as clean as we would like. So if you catch yourself digging through some code and a bit confused in an area, take the time to document it (once you figure out what you didn't understand).</p>
<p>This is especially true when you are the original writer of sed un-clear code. I know I've gone through code I've written and been like, &quot;hmm, no idea what I was thinking here...&quot; or &quot;well, there was a reason I did this stupid thing, but now I don't remember what that was. Wish I would have commented a little more to my future self&quot;.</p>
<p>Sometimes it may be a simple variable rename or refactor that would clean it up. But <strong>don't just figure it out and not leave a breadcrumb</strong> for the next person (or yourself) to more easily grok the code.</p>
<p><strong>Add clarity to un-clear code.</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to solid dev habits, source control should be on the top of your list as a given. So much so that I'm not going to talk about the pro's and pro's (see what I did there?) of source control. I did however, want to walk through something I call my <code>git dance</code> which is mostly just the rhythmic steps I take while pulling in changes from a remote repository while working on a project.</p>
<p>For a little context, this workflow is what I usually do while working on an internal project using git with a team where we may or may not be using pull requests, but the goal of this dance is to bring in any remote changes and layer my changes in on the <code>master</code> branch (or whatever branch we're developing on).</p>
<p>My favorite thing about git is there is no &quot;right way&quot; to do things and when you get good enough at it the 'rules' people place on using git can mostly be wiped away. However, the below steps, while not always followed, are generally what I use to stay happy and healthy when dealing with others changes.</p>
<h1><a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch">Fetch</a> remote changes (don't <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull">pull</a>)</h1>
<p>So if we know or don't know that there are changes remotely</p>
<pre><code>git fetch
</code></pre>
<p>or sometimes (if I have multiple remotes)</p>
<pre><code>git fetch --all
</code></pre>
<p>Why use <code>fetch</code> when I could be using <code>pull</code>?</p>
<p>I prefer to <code>fetch</code> any changes as this gives me the opportunity to review a visual of the commit graph before any action is taken. This allows me to take different paths depending on what the before commit graph looks like vs what I want the after to look like. <code>Git pull</code> is essentially a short-cut for both <code>fetch</code>ing and <code>merge</code>ing the code and I often don't want to just merge a remote change.</p>
<p>After I have any remote changes pulled (err fetched) locally I like to get a mental model of the recent commits.</p>
<h1>Review remote changes</h1>
<pre><code>gitk --all
</code></pre>
<p>Now the <code>gitk</code> U.I. is horrible to look at (and I'm sure you have your favorite git visualizer), but it provides enough info to review changes between the current <code>HEAD</code> of my local branch and any remote changes that have come in with the <code>git fetch</code> step above. The <code>--all</code> is important in gitk, as it will show you all branches (including remote branches) that were fetched.</p>
<p>I use this overview to not only <a href="https://staxmanade.com/2015/09/habit-of-a-solid-developer-self-prescribed-code-reviews/">code review changes</a>, but to help determine whether I want to <code>merge</code> or <code>rebase</code> with the remote changes.</p>
<h1>Merge or Rebase</h1>
<p>Once my review is complete, I've taken a look at the overall changes, and I have a mental model of what the current commit graph looks like. I generate a mental visual of what I want the commit graph to look like when I'm done. I will decide to either:</p>
<h2>Merge</h2>
<pre><code>git merge [origin/master | otherBranch]
</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<h2>Rebase</h2>
<pre><code>git rebase [origin/master | otherBranch]
</code></pre>
<p>Once my changes have been synced up with the remote changes, I push them up.</p>
<h1>Ship changes up to the origin</h1>
<pre><code>git push origin master
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>git push origin &lt;branchName&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now it's not a complicated workflow and it can get a bit trickier, but the key here is doing the fetch, review, integrate workflow over automatically pulling in remote changes. This allows me the space to potentially <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">interactive rebase</a> or muck with my commits locally before pushing anything public.</p>
<p>Happy <code>gitting</code>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One technique I use regularly when working with a team or even by myself is lots of individual code reviews.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>This is not a formal (sit down with someone) code review.</h1>
<p>This is a personal practice I found extremely useful.</p>
<p>Granted, I'm not talking about reviewing every commit in a repository the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0VH78ye4yY">size of Facebooks</a>. Most of the projects I have participated in are on small enough teams (between 1-10 people) that reviewing code changes either as they come in or in some block during the day is completely feasible.</p>
<p>Depending on the project, how many developers, time zones of committers, I shift how often or how thorough I review the changes but I try to review each and every commit (or at least the branch merge). This is one reason why <a href="https://staxmanade.com/2014/02/segregate-your-code-commits-into-tiny/">segregating your code commits into tiny topical changes</a> is important.</p>
<p>If you're working with a source control that doesn't have an easy way to do <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull">pull requests</a>. Or some other code review functionality, you can still use the source control system to manually review changes or diffs between branches. Way back when I was <strong>forced</strong> to use TFS source control this was a much more manual process. I would open up Visual Studio, browse our TFS server and begin reviewing. These days, the power of a pull request is generally suffecient for this purpose.</p>
<h1>What happens in this review?</h1>
<p>One approach I've taken in the past is to block some time, possibly while warming up with a cup of coffee to begin reviewing the previous day's commits. I would use this time to not only review other developer's changes, but I would also re-review my own commits. This helped remind me what I worked on and possibly what I was struggling through the previous day. Reviewing code the next day provided time for my mental perspective to have shifted. I was probably thinking about things a little more clearly after a nights rest. Maybe I'd learned something that could be applied to the problem being worked on and provide better setup for changes needing to be made that day.</p>
<p>Some other benefits the morning review process provided include:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was a bit of a meditative process in the early morning that put my brain on a code thinking track for the day.</li>
<li>I could take notes on changes other's had made that were not clear. (Note: this is generally done in an environment that didn't perscribe peer-reviewing code changes). So I essentially took the job on personally to review other's changes. Provide feedback, or ask question to get more understanding of their changes.</li>
<li>Easily catch when the project conventions were not being followed, when the <a href="https://staxmanade.com/2015/09/habit-of-a-solid-developer-automatically-enforce-project-conventions/">convention was not automated</a>.</li>
<li>Potentially spot bugs being introduced.</li>
<li>Suggest potentially better approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the most important thing I gained by doing this was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain a better understanding of the entire project.</li>
<li>Learn from others. I'd like to think I'm a pretty good develoepr, but there is so much to know and learn that reading other's code provides a great way to learn something new (or possibly what not to do).</li>
</ul>
<p>I once had a fellow developer say to me that they were blown away at how quick I could spin up on a brownfield project and get an architectural understanding that I could apply that knowledge and not only contribute quickly, but spot the places where we could improve general architectural patterns or jump in and become productive on a problem set.</p>
<p>I believe that reviewing the changes going into a code base each day allowed me to keep a strong perspective on what is shifting within the project and be able to talk intelligibly when others start to get stuck on their work.</p>
<h1>Formal Code Reviews</h1>
<p>If your team practices some form of code review workflow, this is great for those participating in the review process. However, it leaves the rest of the developers out of that specific review.</p>
<p>This should not stop those not in the review room (or pull request) from participating and learning from the changes.</p>
<p>Many of the places I've worked don't have a formal review process in place, so by putting this little ritual in place for myself I can not only come up to speed on a project but can be helpful to all aspects of the project. Reviewing changes every day allows me to more easily understand what people were working on when they announce it during the morning standup.</p>
<h1>Just Review Everything</h1>
<p>If you project is small enough and you can - spend a moment each day and review everything going on in the project. You and you're team will likely be better off.</p>
<p>Happy Reviewing!</p>

<p>Every project generates it's own constraints. These may come from an Architect's idea of &quot;best practice&quot; or it may come from the domain the software is written in. It may even be derived because of the programming language you're using. For example, in JavaScript we have linters that encourage rules like triple equals <code>===</code> vs double equals <code>==</code>.</p>
<p>Whatever the convention or rule is, one of the best steps you can take is to <strong>find a way to automatically enforce the convention</strong> once it can be established.</p>
<p>The class of conventions can encompass a wide array of rules; anything from the formatting of the code, naming conventions, to obscure ways of doing X with component Y that if not done in that way will cause problems.</p>
<p>Finding a way to automatically check and enforce conventions will help to not only keep the project on track if a newer developer is onboard and isn't aware of the convention to even catching the most senior developer when they forget the convention all together (It's happened to me - forget).</p>
<h1>An example of a project convention</h1>
<p>In the past, I worked on a mutual fund and stock trading engine. This entire system depended heavily on time in various places like billing, trading, etc. Deep down in the core of the application we built in an abstraction over the core Date implementation. This abstraction allowed us to do things like roll the date back for testing or debugging purposes or simulate billing over time rages.</p>
<p>However, if someone ever used a <code>new Date()</code> in the code, this would break the convention by not using our abstraction and not allow us to roll time properly. This could lead to serious or hard to find bugs.</p>
<p>Detecting the miss-use of Date in this application was a great place for automated enforcement.</p>
<p>The above can be caught by running code reviews. However, we baked this convention into the system and automated the enforcement of it so that the issue could be caught much earlier in the development lifecycle. With a well-placed a unit/integration test that searched through the code base for uses of <code>new Date()</code> and raised an error message explaining why, we were able to be sure the projects convention was held and avoid potential bugs in the future.</p>
<h1>Fail with a solid path forward</h1>
<p>In the automated convention enforcement described above, the convention would not just fail a test with a generic <code>do not use new Date()...</code> message.</p>
<p>This is a good place to document or share a story about why <code>new Date()</code> was not allowed. We failed the test with a long error message that described both why not to use <code>new Date()</code> and we included a sample snippet of what to use in its place.</p>
<p>You want to include the why as well as the what here to make adoption of the conventions easier going forward for those new to the team or project.</p>
<h1>Allow special exclusions</h1>
<p>Most conventions are generalizations that may not ALWAYS be necessary or ideal. There often exceptions to the rule in software development, so allowing the test code to be extended to enable exclusions to this rule is a good thing.</p>
<p>In the example  above we had a place in the unit test that allowed us to say &quot;In component M method Y we allowed the use of a single case of <code>new Date()</code>&quot;. The first exercise of the exclusion was built in to the original abstraction over time. But there were a couple other places we allowed it as I recall.</p>
<h1>Some automation approaches</h1>
<p>Depending on the convention, the approach to automation can vary. Sometimes it's as easy as adding a simple unit test. Other times it requires you jump out to a command line utility that searches the entire codebase.</p>
<p>Whatever the convention, try to come up with a simple approach that can automatically be run through a continuous integration environment and can freely be there to watch over you and your team's conventions.</p>
<h1>Tools to help enforce conventions</h1>
<p>I've started to <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/automated-conventions">compile a small list</a> of tools that you may consider to help enforce conventions on your team. Please feel free to suggest others by submitting a pull-request.</p>
<p>Happy Automating!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I've been thinking about some of the software development related habits that I've practiced and acquired over the years. I thought putting some of these down in posts and sharing would both help me solidify my own thinking on the subjects, but also provide a good place to link other developers or anyone I would like to send a topic when the context justifies it.</p>
<p>For this first post, I'd like to highlight some older posts that fit well into this category:</p>

</ul>
<p>In future posts I'm going to write down some of the habits that I think have helped me become a better developer over the years. While I get glimpses of (being the old guy) in a room of developers, I know that my learning is never done and my future has more personal growth than I can even imagine. Regardless, I hope you find these posts useful.</p>
<p>Happy Deving!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>Respond to emails with <strong>got it</strong>. Or some context-related reply, for example: <strong>thanks</strong> or <strong>will respond with further detail later...</strong></p>
<h1>More Context</h1>
<p>We all know that communication is important, and often where things go awry.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if I'm alone in this thinking, but don't think I am. When I send an important email, I like to know that the person on the other end received it. It may be an email that will take the other person time to respond with the detail necessary, but it's awfully unproductive to send an email, and wait  a day or two before finding out that the communication was never received.</p>
<p>Simply replying with <strong>got it</strong> or <strong>got it, will respond with more detail later...</strong> is a great way to notify me that you've received the email (and may take some time to respond).</p>
<p>I don't necessarily care that my email takes priority, but at least knowing that the other end has seen it is 1/2 the battle.</p>

<p>A standard task I began placing in my projects lately is one that easily integrates with my build tool of choice (rake, psake, etc&#8230;) and when run, installs a git pre-commit hook into my local copy of the repo that will run tests before code is committ. I&#8217;ve fancied calling the task <em><a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/PutOnAHelmet">putOnAHelmet</a></em>.</p> <p>Come checkout a small <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/PutOnAHelmet">little github repo </a> I started to keep track of various versions of this and feel free to open an issue or send a pull request with another one!</p> <p>I don&#8217;t want to get into details about pre-commit hooks and how you should author them in this post (maybe we can expand the language in the repo&#8217;s readme&#8230;). You can also check <a href="http://bit.ly/1bit9Pe">out other writings</a>&#8230; But one of the biggest problems I have with them is gits in-ability to easily keep track of pre-commit hooks much like it can with the rest of the projects source. </p> <p>Now it&#8217;s true that different people need the ability to customize these, but a general &#8220;running of tests&#8221; before committing is a great first step and I&#8217;ve found these set of tasks the easiest way to carry them from repo to repo.</p> <p>Hope others find this useful!</p> <p>Happy committing!</p></div>

<div class="entry-content"><p>If you're not using source control for your coding projects, get off my lawn. :P (#JustHadToSayIt)</p>
<p>Now that I'm only reaching people who use source control (serious developers), I'd like to ask that you focus hard to only commit changes that belong to a single topic at a time. Think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">SRP</a> for code commits/check-ins.</p>
<h4>What is a topical commit?</h4>
<p>That almost looks like 'tropical' and wouldn't it be nice to be in a tropical place doing commits to your code, but I digress...</p>
<p>The topics I'm referring to are specific functional units of change where each tiny commit is related to a single topic or theme.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding feature X</li>
<li>refactoring</li>
<li>bug fix</li>
<li>spelling fix</li>
<li>Updating comments/documentation</li>
<li>*** code formatting ***</li>
</ul>
<p>I highlighted that last one for a reason as it's the impetus for writing this post.</p>
<h3>Don't mix topics/themes within a single commit!</h3>
<p>Instead break them into multiple commits. If you're using git, checkout '<a href="http://johnkary.net/blog/git-add-p-the-most-powerful-git-feature-youre-not-using-yet/">git add -p</a>'</p>
<p>If you have a one line bug fix but the file has 20 lines of code formatting changes (you know who you are). It makes determining what the bug fix is nearly impossible from the changes that are code formatting.</p>
<p>Using tools like git bisect to look at history become difficult. Pull Requests in GitHub become difficult to understand. If you've left a codebase for a while and come back, try reading changes that have happened over time to get caught up can be extremely difficult to do if your commits are not topically based.</p>
<p>Let's just NOT mix topics in our commits, ok?</p>
<p>K, THX bye!</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>

<p>Have you ever arrived at work and sat down, not exactly sure what you were working on the day before? You spend some time going through emails. Start looking at your codebase, maybe the last couple commits you made trying to get back into the mental groove you were in the day before.</p>  <p>There is a <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=get+back+into+programming+after+interruption" target="_blank">lot of information</a> about how long it takes to get back into the programming zone. <strong>If you leave yourself a breadcrumb or two, it is much easier to get started when you come back to your task.</strong></p>  <h3>Some of my favorite breadcrumbs.</h3>  <h4>Leave a failing unit test.</h4>  <p>If you practice any sort of test driven development, leaving a failing test to pick up the next day can be one of the most useful methods to get going again when you come back to the problem. If you’ve spent the time to think through the problem enough to write a failing unit test, this can help to ease you into the task at hand and get rolling the next day. </p>  <h4>Explicitly leave a note or compiler error in the code.</h4>  <p>Now, it’s probably common to check your working code in at the end of the day, but sometimes you just can’t work it to completion. That’s ok, and if you use a tool that supports something like this, leave yourself a breadcrumb of one or more compiler errors.</p>  <p>If I’m writing some C# I sometimes use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/x5hedts0.aspx" target="_blank">#error precompiler</a> directive with a helpful message.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-3BSP6C9ismg/UqFnBqT43GI/AAAAAAAAAiI/BvwY-gpVO-o/s1600-h/image3.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-XgX7jyzCT_c/UqFnCTtDw7I/AAAAAAAAAiQ/o5EgtBxl_vA/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800" width="531" height="177" /></a></p>  <p>This allows me to come in the next day. Hit build on the project and immediately see where I was in the codebase last and need to pick up again.</p>  <h4>Other, less specific, but useful options:</h4>  <ul>   <li>Send yourself an email describing what you’re working on and what still needs to be done. </li>    <li>Write in your favorite notes app. I like to use OneNote to keep track of my ‘scrum notes’ which help me describe what I did today and what I plan on doing tomorrow. </li>    <li>Sticky note? (can’t say I’ve used a pen/paper in a while – but if it works for you go for it)</li> </ul>  <p>It doesn’t have to be anything special, just a little note to yourself that can help you get a jump start on your next task at hand.</p>  <p>What other methods do you use to get back into the problem at hand?</p>  </div>

<p>Today the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_manager">PM</a> of a project I am working on sent an email with a small list of issues that we needed to get resolved before shipping an early build to the customer for a weekly review. In his list of issues MY NAME was tagged next to a feature that I KNOW was working. I dev’d it, tested, saw it work.</p>
<p>Now the project I’m working on encourages unit tested code, which is a fantastic project to be on since I am a big proponent of Unit/Integration/Automated tests. Heck I wrote a tool to help run them easier (<a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/">StatLight</a>).</p>
<h4>What I did.</h4>
<p>The problem was this. I dev’d a feature out in like 5 minutes, took about 2 seconds to decide if I should write a unit test to prove my feature worked and <b>this</b>
<b>
  <i>
  </i>
</b>
<b>is where I failed</b>. Manually verified my change checked in the production code without its test and I was hurriedly moved on to the next task.</p>
<p>About 20 min later I get a quick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">I.M.</a> from a co-worker saying he had a small merge conflict in the file I just checked-in. Quickly told him how to get around his merge issue (not realizing after he checked in) that my “quick 5min dev task” was accidently removed in the merge.</p>
<h4>What I SHOULD have done!</h4>
<p>What I<b> should </b>have done was write the <strong>2 lines of test code first</strong>. <i>(you can argue test after/test first, I prefer test-first)</i>. Proven my code wasn’t working, by running the test, and then implement the 5 min feature making the test pass. Then when my co-worker ran into his merge issue.</p>
<p>
  <img src="http://boldandfab.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/pow.jpg" width="179" height="126" />
</p>
<p>Test would have failed telling him his merge didn’t go as planned.</p>
<h4>This would have also avoided</h4>
<ul>
  <li>PM wouldn’t have had to discover the issue, Screenshot and write up an email. </li>
  <li>I wouldn’t have had to peruse source control history to understand why my “working” feature wasn’t working. </li>
  <li>I wouldn’t have had to willingly confess my sins in this post.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your feature doesn’t have a coinciding automated test. How do you know it’s still working?</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>
