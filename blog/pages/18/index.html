Daniel from the Moq project tweeted Scott Bellware about his spec unit projects <a href="http://code.google.com/p/specunit-net/source/browse/trunk/src/SpecUnit/SpecificationExtensions.cs?r=41" target="_blank">SpecificationExtensions.cs</a></h5><blockquote><p>@bellware shouldn't specunit ShouldNotEqual/etc. return the actual object rather than the expected? To chain other calls <a href="http://is.gd/iJuB">http://is.gd/iJuB</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>@bellware and ShouldBeNull/NotBeNull could also return the object: obj.ShouldNotBeNull().ShouldEqual(...), right?</p></blockquote><p>with Scott's response being...</p><blockquote><p>@kzu no because that would contribute to crowding many observations into a single method</p></blockquote><p>To that I say, True, if you are doing pure Context/Specification based unit testing. However most of us aren't actually doing it (maybe we should?) so why not allow the test to say</p><pre>someString<br />  .ShouldNotBeNull<br />  .ShouldEqual(...)?</pre><p>So for now... I'm going to continue to go with the Fluent Specification Extensions.</p>  </div>

<p>If you read my previous post about <a href="/2009/02/fluent-specification-extensions">Fluent Specification Extensions</a> then you know that I'm still in an experimental phase of this idea.</p>  <p>I'd like to share one more positive I found by using the specification extensions in my testing framework. This benefit is there weather you use standard specification extension methods or try the fluent specification extensions. The idea is very basic, but I didn't even realize it's benefit until I ran into it directly.</p>  <p>And the great benefit is... (drum roll...errr..actually it's not mind blowing). By using extensions methods to provide assertion extensions on the objects we're testing, we've<strong> <u>abstracted the actual testing framework's assertion process.</u></strong><u> </u>(told you it wasn't mind blowing, but read along and see an example of how this abstraction could be good)</p>  <p>Now I know most times you won't ever change testing frameworks, however I just ran into this when attempting to port the Castle.DynamicProxy2 (DP2) to Silverlight. Their test project leveraged the NUnit testing framework, which hasn't officially been ported. You can find a quick <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2009/01/nunit-and-silverlight/">port by Jeff Wilcox</a> that will run in the Microsoft Silverlight Unit Testing Framework. However when I was porting the DP2 that hadn't been done, and I didn't feel like porting NUnit at the time.</p>  <p>So, by providing this abstraction layer (through the extension methods). You could then go in and easily swap what testing framework your project is leveraging to do it's assertions.</p>  <h6>NOTE: the port from NUnit to MSFT wouldn't have been that easy as the [TestMethod] in MSFT is sealed so I couldn't create a [Test] attribute that inherited from [TestMethod] to get the SL testing framework to run the tests w/out changing the DynamicProxy test code...aside from that issue...</h6>  <p>Let's take a concrete example of this abstraction benefit.</p>  <p>Notice how the Assert.IsInstanceOfType() in both NUnit and Microsoft's testing framework have the parameters reversed.</p>  <p>NUnit:</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SY0lvWzbk4I/AAAAAAAAAEw/mikfS2Ad9TQ/s1600-h/image11%5B3%5D.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="146" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SY0lv1_mpxI/AAAAAAAAAE0/UMgoOPFIoiY/image11_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="584" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Microsoft:</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SY0lwEt7LjI/AAAAAAAAAE4/cj4aScmZML4/s1600-h/image17%5B1%5D.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="104" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SY0lwbo9p9I/AAAAAAAAAE8/xklqX1ujQj4/image17_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="584" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>If you were trying to switch from NUnit to MSFT or visa versa, a simple search and replace on [Test] for [TestMethod] would suffice for the majority of the needed port. However the Assert.IsInstanceOfType() would fail at compile time because of the parameter order. (and who know what else exactly is different)</p>  <p>If you could provide that layer of abstraction for the assertions, then to switch between NUnit and MSFT or visa versa would remain very simple, as you would only have to provide the framework specific changes only once.</p>  </div>

<p><strong>FYI: If you're familiar with extension methods, and how to use them in testing sceneries...the interesting part of this post is at the bottom starting at: "Ok, on to the point..."</strong></p><p>The C# extension methods give some amazing power when it comes to extending functionality of objects (we don't own) and I've spotted a pattern on several blogs and example unit testing snippets, especially in the Context Specification style testing areas that I find interesting.   <br /><br />The concept is to basically use the C# extension methods within a unit testing environment to give the system under test (SUT) more readability/understandability within the test code itself.   <br /><br />Here's an example of how you might normally write a unit test given the following SUT. </p>  <pre><span style="color:#0000ff;">public</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">class</span> SystemUnderTest<br />{<br />  <span style="color:#0000ff;">public</span> SystemUnderTest() { PropertyUnderTest = "<span style="color:#8b0000;">Hello World!</span>"; }<br />  <span style="color:#0000ff;">public</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">string</span> SomeStringProperty { <span style="color:#0000ff;">get</span>; <span style="color:#0000ff;">set</span>; }<br />  <span style="color:#0000ff;">public</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">bool</span> SomeBoolProperty { <span style="color:#0000ff;">get</span>; <span style="color:#0000ff;">set</span>; }<br />}</pre><p>You might write some unit tests that might look like...</p><pre>var sut = <span style="color:#0000ff;">new</span> SystemUnderTest();<br /><br />Assert.IsTrue(sut.SomeBoolProperty);<br />Assert.AreEqual(sut.SomeStringProperty, "<span style="color:#8b0000;">Hello World!</span>");</pre><p>Now, the assertions above are small enough it's pretty easy to tell what's going on, however when you think about what your looking at, it actually present the best readability.</p><p>Let's take the string's AreEqual assertion for example...  You first read the "AreEqual", so now you have to allocate some (undefined as of yet) space in your head to store some data points that need to be evaluated all at once. (maybe I'm getting lazy as I get old, but the less I have to think when reading tests the more time I can spend understanding the domain being tested...)</p><p>Again, the example is over simplified, but I think you get the point.</p><h4>What if you could make the test syntax read and flow in a very readable and understandable manner?</h4><p>That's what the specification extensions give you. Given the two tests above and an a couple helper extension methods living in the testing library I could write something like.</p><pre>var sut = <span style="color:#0000ff;">new</span> SystemUnderTest();<br />sut.SomeBoolProperty.ShouldBeTrue();<br />sut.SomeBoolProperty.ShouldEqual("<span style="color:#8b0000;">Hello World!</span>");</pre><p>It may just be me, but that just feels better, is more understandable, and the great thing is I didn't have to impact my domain objects to support this style of test...</p><p>Another great benefit is you don't have to type "Assert.xxxx(YYzzz)" each time you want to create an assertion. You can just type sut.SomeThing.{this where you get help from intellasense} giving you some great context based assertion options.</p><p>I googled for a library that had a pre-built set of extension assertions and ended up finding the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/specunit-net/source/browse/">http://code.google.com/p/specunit-net/source/browse/</a> by Scott Bellware. If you dig into the source of the project you can find a helper class called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/specunit-net/source/browse/trunk/src/SpecUnit/SpecificationExtensions.cs" target="_blank">SpecificationExtensions.cs</a> which basically gives you all the "Should..{your assertion here}" extension methods.</p><h4>Ok, on to the point real point (sorry it's taken so long).</h4><p>After downloading and playing with the extension specifications from Spec Unit, I thought what if we made that more fluent?</p><p>So I gave it a quick spike and instead of writing some tests that look like...</p><pre>sut.SomeStringProperty.ShouldNotBeNull();<br />sut.SomeStringProperty.ShouldBeOfType(<span style="color:#0000ff;">typeof</span>(<span style="color:#0000ff;">string</span>));<br />sut.SomeStringProperty.ShouldEqual("<span style="color:#8b0000;">Hello World!</span>"); </pre><p>You could have less wordy code and still retain all the meaning and readability with a set of fluent specification extensions.</p><pre>sut.SomeStringProperty<br />.ShouldNotBeNull()<br />.ShouldBeOfType(<span style="color:#0000ff;">typeof</span>(<span style="color:#0000ff;">string</span>))<br />.ShouldEqual("<span style="color:#8b0000;">Hello World!</span>");</pre><p>I haven't figured out what sorts of bad things this style of assertion could bring... but we'll experiment for a while...</p><p>Here's an example console app with the extensions included.</p><p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: I haven't tested all the extensions so if you notice any issues please feel free to let me know...<br /><br /><iframe style="border-right: #dde5e9 1px solid; padding-right: 0px; border-top: #dde5e9 1px solid; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 3px; border-left: #dde5e9 1px solid; width: 240px; padding-top: 0px; border-bottom: #dde5e9 1px solid; height: 66px; background-color: #ffffff" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://cid-c0f357e4555270e7.skydrive.live.com/embedrowdetail.aspx/Public/FluentSpecificationExtensions.zip" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p></div>

I just added this helpful extension method to my code. Thought of sharing it.<br /><br />public static IEnumerable ShouldContain(this IEnumerable collection, Func expectedCriteria)<br />        {<br />            collection.Any(expectedCriteria).ShouldBeTrue();<br />            return collection;<br />        }</div>

<p>A couple weeks back I threw out a <a href="/2009/01/silverlight-moq-automocker-teaser" target="_blank">Teaser about a Silverlight AutoMocker</a>...

It tried porting the NAnt build to Silverlight and each of the 3 times I got so lost I gave up... :( </li>        <li>Fix the Castle.Core-Silverlight build (some changes have occurred to the main without being pushed to the Silverlight Version) </li>        <li>Create an official binaries of          <ol>           <li>Castle.Core </li>            <li>Castle.DynamicProxy </li>         </ol>       </li>     </ol>   </li>    <li>Port Moq to Silverlight      <ol>       <li>I supplied a patch to Daniel a while ago, but he said he wouldn't include it until #1 above. </li>     </ol>   </li> </ol>  <p>But until the official versions become available, here are what I have so far!!!</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: oops, realized I posted the files below as .7z.

@Mark<br /><br />I&#39;ve been disconnected from the castle dynamic proxy for quite a while. (Last I knew Mr. Rossi was going to get it into the build process) If that&#39;s true, building from src would be your best bet. If it&#39;s not possible through the NAnt script, then, the way I originally did it, was opening up the Silverlight project in VS and building that way... (I think you have to run the NAnt build at least once for it to setup the AssemblyInfo.cs stuff before you try to vs build)<br /><br />Hope this helps. (sorry I don&#39;t have more info than this)</div>

Re: the error with generic constraints - I created a test for this and it is fixed on the main build see here: http://support.castleproject.org/projects/DYNPROXY/issues/view/DYNPROXY-ISSUE-92<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure how to get this into a silverlight version - there doesn&#39;t seem to be a Silverlight build. Can you help?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Mark</div>

Hi Jason, <BR/>This is really cool...thanks!<BR/><BR/>I thought you might want to know about an error I received. When mocking an interface containing generic parameter constraints, I receive the error... <BR/><BR/>System.BadImageFormatException: An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.<BR/><BR/>...when running the test. <BR/><BR/>Thanks!</div>

@Adam - There's two things you can do.<BR/><BR/>1. Moq-contrib at google code already has an AutoMocker that uses the AutoFac IoC.<BR/><BR/>or<BR/><BR/>2. Take my source, recompile the AutoMocker in .net (make sure to get the correct full-framework dependencies)<BR/><BR/>Hope that helps...</div>

Not sure what you mean bout the "trick"... Mocking just works in Silverlight with Moq. There is one unit test that fails in the Silverlight version when trying to mock the System.Stream class. I didn't dig too far into the specific failure, however I'm sure there are lots of things out there that you won't be allowed to mock because of the security restrictions...</div>

In a nutshell, what's the trick to mocking with the given security constraints (on reflection) in Silverlight?</div>

<p>I know what you're thinking (or at least what I was thinking before I knew better). What is the Castle.DynamicProxy and who cares it was ported to Silverlight?</p>  <p>To be honest I didn't know it existed until I tried to find a mocking framework for doing Silverlight unit testing. Then I found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/issues/detail?id=73" target="_blank">this thread</a> over on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/" target="_blank">Moq</a> mocking framework's home site which talked about needing to get the Castle.DynamicProxy ported before Moq could be ported to Silverlight.</p>  <p>Turns out, the DynamicProxy is one of the core dependencies of the two major open source mocking frameworks out there. <em>(Moq, and Rhino Mocks)...</em><em>(I'm sure there's others out there, but for now I only care about Moq because it's what we use at work)</em></p>  <p>After sitting around for about three months since I first read the thread and not hearing any word about the DynamicProxy being ported, I thought I'd take a stab.</p>  <p>Joined the castle devl email group, threw a ping about the port and I was off...after a couple weeks several late nights, and a few patch submittal turn-backs by hammett I finally got the patch in a place he liked and he applied it on Jan 3 2009.</p>  <p>What a great feeling of relief, this was a big step forward to getting full mocking support in Silverlight.</p>  <p>There is still one pending thing with the DynamicProxy &amp; all Castle.Silverlight projects to date...we need to integrate the build and testing into their NAnt builds. Once that's done and a binary release is out, Moq port to Silverlight...here I come. </p>  <p>p.s. I already have a patch for Moq, but <a href="http://code.google.com/u/kzu.net/" target="_blank">Daniel</a> said he won't apply it till he can get the &quot;official&quot; binaries, which is fine. I would probably do the same if I were overseeing a decent sized open source project like Moq.</p>  <p>Soon enough...we'll have Silverlight mocking...</p>  </div>

<p>If you're doing any Silverlight development you've probably run into the problem <em>&quot;some method/property/functionality I'm used to using doesn't exist in the core framework&quot;</em> provided by Microsoft<em>.</em></p>  <p>What are your options?</p>  <ol>   <li>Write the logic yourself (you just might have to)</li>    <li>Use reflector on the full framework to see how it's done and attempt to (go back to step 1. )</li>    <li><strong>Or one I've been using lately. Take a look at the Mono project.</strong></li> </ol>  <p><em>DISCLAIMER: I'm not very familiar with much of the legal side of this option, so I highly recommend understanding Mono's licensing before going too far with their source.</em></p>  <p>However it's still a great source for learning how to implement something that was tucked away in the full framework's BCL.</p>  <p>And, with the power of Google, you can easily find what you're looking for...</p>  <p>Let's give an example:</p>  <p>Say, for instance, you need the IsNested property off of the System.Type object. The Silverlight version doesn't have that property, so let's go find out how it's implemented in Mono.</p>  <p>enter in a google serch: (we'll limit the search to the mono project's exposed svn site)</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong><em><u>site:anonsvn.mono-project.com System.Type IsNested</u></em></strong></p>  <p><strong><em><u></u></em></strong></p>  <p>The second link down is the one we want.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SV5p_nNNnVI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/HcbLAdNoXgc/s1600-h/image%5B7%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="197" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SV5qAcSPA4I/AAAAAAAAAEU/gl90iUeNPRY/image_thumb%5B5%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="404" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Then you can click on &quot;View&quot; in the &quot;Links to HEAD&quot;</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SV5qBYAL-YI/AAAAAAAAAEY/CNxiTsUDgtc/s1600-h/image%5B11%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="224" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SV5qB8YAqzI/AAAAAAAAAEc/nY_Tq4eOetc/image_thumb%5B7%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="404" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>And you end up looking at the .cs file source for System.Type.

<p><span style="font-size:85%;">We've removed the IndexableAttribute from the i4o library and replaced it with the IndexSpecification&lt;T&gt;.

Hello @Satyanarayana<br /><br />I would be happy to help you, but have a request and a couple questions...<br /><br />1. I've realized my blog comments are starting to become a bit more of the i4o knowledge base than it deserves. Would you please ask your question over on the i4o Discussion board?<br /><br />2. I'd like a little more detail. What does the xml structure look like? What does the linq query look like that returns your "grouped" data? What is it you are trying to index/search?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jason</div>

I have a question how to use IndexSpecification for a nested collections in a xml file. For example<br />University<br />   Course<br />      Student<br /><br />I have list of Students from a various Courses and various Universities. I used Linq for Grouping Universities and Courses of Students. Now, I have question how to implement Indexing on Students, Courses and Universities.<br />Please give the implementation details .<br /><br />Thanks <br />Satya</div>

At first, I was thinking of modifying i4o but after I have been testing, I have found the power behind i4o with simple changes the way you write query.<BR/><BR/>For example:  <BR/><BR/>Instead of writing this..<BR/>var f = indexedFileInfosFromDir.Where(fi =&gt; fi.Extension == &quot;txt&quot; &amp;&amp; fi.IsReadOnly == true);<BR/><BR/>Try this..<BR/>var f = indexedFileInfosFromDir.Where(fi =&gt; fi.Extension == &quot;txt&quot;);<BR/>var f2 = f.Where(fi.IsReadOnly == true);<BR/><BR/>(fi.Extension should be smaller group than fi.IsReadOnly)<BR/><BR/>From what I have tested,<BR/>It responses within a few milisecond.<BR/>I am happy with this.<BR/><BR/>Thank you for great work.</div>

@Paiwan - I'm glad to see you're running your own benchmarks to test out the library.<BR/><BR/>Please keep in mind that this library is very simple, and is not a complete Linq implementation.<BR/><BR/>It provides some great benefits in the scenarios it was designed for. And I know Aaron has some more improvements on the way.<BR/><BR/>If you create any patches for the project, we are happy to take a look at any improvements you can come up with.<BR/><BR/>Thanks again</div>

@Paiwan To test your question I wrote a unit test and just checked it in. You can view the test here http://i4o.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/31862#398075<BR/><BR/>If this is what you were asking, then no it will not update the index.<BR/><BR/>You need to call the  IndexableCollection&lt;T&gt;.Add/Remove and not it&#39;s base type Collection&lt;T&gt;.Add/Remove for the indexes to be updated.<BR/><BR/>This is however something we&#39;d like to support in the future, which is why I checked in the failing test. We probably need to just implement ICollection&lt;T&gt; etc... and to fully support this.</div>

Hi Jason,<BR/><BR/>I have a question.<BR/>If we have some changes on our base collection like add or delete, do we have to re create index or do some special steps?<BR/><BR/>Thanks,<BR/>Paiwan</div>

Ok, thanks for the confirmation. I wanted to make sure I wasn't crazy. :-)<BR/><BR/>I was excited when I saw your post and really like the syntax for adding properties to the IndexSpecification. Now, I guess I'll just wait until I can actually use it like that. From Aaron's blog, it sounds like he plans to introduce updates to the Where expression in the next release.<BR/><BR/>Thanks for your work on this library. I'm hoping this will make it possible to replace a subsytem of our app which currently relies on looking up factors in large in-memory sets of data by using XML. It loads large XML documents into memory and builds XPath queries to get to individual factors that it needs. The XPath queries themselves are pretty past, but I'm trying to use Linq-to-XML to project the XML into collections of strongly type objects that I can query with Where lambda's instead. It works well, but when the collections are large enough the queries are too much slower than the XPath version. I'm hoping the IndexableCollection will make it possible.<BR/><BR/>Kevin</div>

<div class='author'>Jason.Jarrett</div>

That's a good point and I think you are correct...<BR/><BR/>I was just illustrating the power of the IndexSpecification. Unfortunately the extension methods used to evaluate the expression need some work.</div>

<div class='author'>Kevin</div>
<div class='content'>
Hi Jason,<BR/><BR/>Thanks for this post. I got to it from the i4o home page on Codeplex. I noticed in the discussions that someone mentioned the fact that if you have multiple expressions in your Where expression, that it won&#39;t use the index.<BR/><BR/>So does that mean, your example showing multiple properties being added to the index doesn&#39;t really help if you wanted to search your collection on both of the properties in the index?<BR/><BR/>For example, would this code use the index?<BR/><BR/>var f = indexedFileInfosFromDir.Where(fi =&gt; fi.Extension == &quot;txt&quot; &amp;&amp; fi.IsReadOnly == true);<BR/><BR/>From my testing, it appears that no benefit is achieved from using an IndexableCollection vs. a regular List in this case. Seems like there&#39;s no point in using the IndexableCollection if you need more than one property in the index. Am I missing something or is that correct?<BR/><BR/>Thanks,<BR/>Kevin</div>

<p>Recently I was added as a developer to the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/i4o" target="_blank">i4o codeplex project</a> by <a href="http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/aarone/default.aspx" target="_blank">Aaron</a> and last night I made my first commit.</p>  <p>There were a few pretty big changes to the library. I'll highlight some of them below, and in a couple future posts will describe in a little more detail how you can use these features.</p>  <h4>Removed the IndexableAttribute:</h4>  <p>This was removed for two reasons.</p>  <ul>   <li>It did not allow you index objects you didn't own. </li> </ul>  <p>Say you want to index a collection of System.IO.FileInfo objects. Since that's owned by the .Net framework, you can't apply an attribute to the properties of the class you want to index.</p>  <p>The solution to that was to allow adding indexed properties dynamically, however you had to give it a string representing the property name, which leads into the second issue... </p>  <ul>   <li>Didn't provide any compile time checking or refactor support for properties using the dynamic add/remove methods. </li> </ul>  <p>If you refactored a property and forgot to rename the string to match the refactor you would end up with a runtime error.</p>  <p>To resolve the two issues above I've introduced the <strong>IndexSpecification&lt;T&gt;</strong> (I'll describe how to use it a later post)</p>  <h4>Performance tuning:</h4>  <p>Although we haven't enhanced the Linq support for IndexableCollection (should come soon), I was able to eek some performance by doing some internal caching of property types and a few other tweaks resulting in the Index creation becoming about 30% faster...</p>  <h4>Fluent interface for managing the Indexes</h4>  <p>The last big change which fits in with the IndexSpecification&lt;T&gt; is the Fluent interface for dynamically adding/removing properties to be indexed. One short example could be:</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SU1DKLdou8I/AAAAAAAAAD4/JBUBIgkDNNo/s1600-h/image3.png"><img style="border-width: 0px;" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SU1DKcGWDjI/AAAAAAAAAD8/zU7TUvRY2T0/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800" width="347" border="0" height="217" /></a></p></div>

<p>I decided to start blogging a little more regularly and one of the first things I ran into when researching the easiest way to create/publish blogs was <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a>. </p>  <p>I'm sold... This program handles just about everything I could need for blogging (I'm new to it, so haven't pushed it's limitations to far).</p>  <p>One problem I had with Live Writer was it saved all my drafts/posts on the computer I was logged into at the time. This meant the drafts I write at home can't be accessed at work and visa/versa...</p>  <p>To solve this I decided to wire them through the <a href="http://mesh.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Mesh</a>. If you haven't setup your mesh yet, I would highly recommend it. Just go to <a href="http://mesh.com" target="_blank">Mesh.com</a>, sign up/or in with a Windows Live account, install the client application, and your <strong>meshified</strong>...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>With Live Mesh, you can synchronize files with all of your devices, so you always have the latest versions handy. Access your files from any device or from the web, easily share them with others, and get notified whenever someone changes a file.</p> </blockquote>  <p>This means I can synchronize folders between my connected computers.</p>  <h4>Below I'll show the steps I used to setup my meshified weblog posts. </h4>  <ol>   <li>Find the location your Live Writer is storing your drafts/posts.      <br />      <br />For my Windows XP machine it was in...       <br /><em>C:\Documents and Settings\JasonJ\My Documents\My Weblog Posts\</em>       <br />      <br />For my work Vista pc the folder was in...       <br /><em>C:\Users\JasonJ\Documents\My Weblog Posts\ </em>      <br /></li>    <li>Next I created a folder in my mesh called &quot;BlogDrafts&quot;.      <br />      <br /><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SUskAwaA5eI/AAAAAAAAADg/8Q7CFRAD8Eo/s1600-h/image3.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="251" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SUskBgLf4RI/AAAAAAAAADk/PZqLvbz2NgQ/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800" width="371" border="0" /></a> To do this you can right click in the mesh folder area and select &quot;Create folder in Live Mesh&quot;.<a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SUskCKk4VWI/AAAAAAAAADo/irg_OvuZjnU/s1600-h/image7.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="176" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SUskCoUxmFI/AAAAAAAAADs/JZV3udqjb4A/image_thumb3.png?imgmax=800" width="347" border="0" /></a> </li>    <li>A window will popup asking for the name of the new folder and the location this folder will live on your hard drive.      <br />      <br /><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SUskC_C6DeI/AAAAAAAAADw/s6bfcg4WOls/s1600-h/image14.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="123" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SUskDkjoclI/AAAAAAAAAD0/Ty6ZI-bJJAo/image_thumb8.png?imgmax=800" width="244" border="0" /></a>&#160; </li> </ol>  <p>I think that's everything... follow similar steps to get your other computers synced up to the mesh and you should be relieved that you can work on any computer and on any post.</p>  </div>
