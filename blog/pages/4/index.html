<div class="entry-content"><p>We recently setup a new <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> build server for some iOS applications and I wanted to find a quick way to copy a couple Jobs from the old server to the new one.</p>
<p>Below are a few small options I found while working on the task.</p>
<h2>Option 1: Copy <code>jobs</code> directory</h2>
<p>One option (and seems to be the recommended one) is to just copy the <code>jobs</code> directory from the old server to the new one.</p>
<p>From the documentation <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Administering+Jenkins#AdministeringJenkins-Moving%2Fcopying%2Frenamingjobs">Moving/copying/renaming jobs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move a job from one installation of Jenkins to another by simply copying the corresponding job directory.</li>
<li>Make a copy of an existing job by making a clone of a job directory by a different name.</li>
<li>Rename an existing job by renaming a directory. Note that the if you change a job name you will need to change any other job that tries to call the renamed job.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those operations can be done even when Jenkins is running. For changes like these to take effect, you have to click &quot;reload config&quot; to force Jenkins to reload configuration from the disk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, I skipped this option because I was having a hard time finding where the jobs directory was on the old server. (Or just too lazy to find it, and I only had a couple jobs to copy over)</p>
<h2>Option 2: Try one of the plugins out there</h2>
<p>There are some Jenkins plugins out there that provide some job export options. Here are a couple...</p>
<ul>
<li><s><a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+Exporter+Plugin">Job Exporter Plugin</a></s> Thanks to a comment below for pointing out this doesn't actually export jobs - but environment variables when the task runs...</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+Import+Plugin">Job Importer Plugin</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Option 3: Use <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI">Jenkins CLI</a></h2>
<p>This is what I used, which worked nicely for only the few jobs we had. If you have a large number of Jenkins jobs, you may consider the first aproach above.</p>
<ol>
<li>First download the Jenkins CLI jar.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can do this from your jenkin's CLI page within your installed Jenkins instance.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/posts/JenkinsCLIMenu.png" alt="jenkins CLI menu"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Next we can use the following command (pointing to the old server) to list the jobs.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://&lt;YourBuildServer&gt;:&lt;YourBuildServerPort&gt;/ list-jobs</code></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Using one job from the list above, let's copy the xml of a job to the clipboard. (I'm using a <code>Mac</code> which is were <code>pbcopy</code> &amp; <code>pbpaste</code> come from below)</li>
</ol>
<p><code>java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://&lt;YourBuildServer&gt;:&lt;YourBuildServerPort&gt;/ get-job &quot;NAME_OF_JOB&quot; | pbcopy</code></p>
<p>This uses the cli <code>get-job &quot;NAME_OF_JOB&quot;</code> command to print the job's xml to <code>stdout</code>, which we pipe to <code>pbcopy</code> on the Mac to load the configuration into the clipboard. You could of course pipe the output to a file like <code>... &gt; job.xml</code></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>If the above command placed a job's XML into the clipboard, you can use the below command to add it to the new server.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>pbpaste | java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://&lt;YourBuildServer&gt;:&lt;YourBuildServerPort&gt; create-job &quot;NAME_OF_JOB&quot;</code></p>
<p>This uses <code>pbpaste</code> to take what is in the clipboard, send it to <code>stdin</code> and pipe it to the Jenkins cli's <code>create-job &quot;NAME_OF_JOB&quot;</code> command.</p>
<p>Hope this helps...</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Formatting your code so it follows whatever conventions your team/company/self define is important. As developers who have to read code on a regular basis, you have to train ourselves to mentally parse code and spot where bugs may be lurking.</p>
<p>However, if your code is not formatted in a consistent fashion, the cognitive load placed on your brain increases dramatically. Not only do you have to read, parse, and conceptualize the code you're reviewing, your brain is now having to decide if anomalies in the formatting of your project's source code are because of a problem in the code, or merely a difference in the code formatting or styling.</p>
<p>Easy and automatic code formatting tools were something I really missed when I started using Xcode because Visual Studio's built-in formatting of a file is as simple as <code>CTRL+k+d</code>.</p>
<p>This has definitely improved in recent years with the introduction of <a href="http://alcatraz.io/">Alcatraz</a> and <a href="https://github.com/travisjeffery/ClangFormat-Xcode">ClangFormat-Xcode</a> and I'd highly recommend you check them out.</p>
<p>But, what if you just acquired a legacy project, that was hacked on by quite a number of different developers, with different styles, that's a total mess (from a style consistency perspective)? Or what if you wanted to have an easy <code>rake</code> task that automatically formatted the necessary code files?</p>
<p>This is where a great little tool from the <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a> project <code>clang-format</code> comes in handy.</p>
<p><s>Unfortunately it's not as easy to install as <code>brew install clang-format</code></s> (It's now as easy to install as <code>brew install clang-format</code>), but I'll show you not only how to get it installed manually, but a command to easily format your code.</p>
<h1>How to install <code>clang-format</code> manually</h1>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://nacho4d-nacho4d.blogspot.de/2013/11/clang-format.html">this post</a> for describing how to get (an older version of the tool), I put together the following steps that I hope you find useful.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="http://llvm.org/releases/download.html">LLVM Download page</a></li>
<li>In chrome dev tools (On my mac, <code>⌘+⌥+J</code> aka <code>CMD+Option+J, make sure the</code>Elements<code>tab is selected, and</code>CMD+F<code>within the html source for</code>macosx-apple-darwin`.
<ul>
<li>as of writing this, I get a link to the following url <a href="http://llvm.org/releases/3.5.0/clang+llvm-3.5.0-macosx-apple-darwin.tar.xz"><code>http://llvm.org/releases/3.5.0/clang+llvm-3.5.0-macosx-apple-darwin.tar.xz</code></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Copy that URL and place it into the following set of commands.</li>
</ol>
<p>From a command prompt, navigate to a folder where you'd like to save or store the <code>clang</code> tools.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the older version if there was one, and create a folder to work in
<code>rm -rf ./clang-format/ &amp;&amp; mkdir -p ./clang-format</code></li>
<li>Take the previously discovered link from above and use the following to download it into our working folder.
<code>curl 'http://llvm.org/releases/3.5.0/clang+llvm-3.5.0-macosx-apple-darwin.tar.xz' -o './clang-format/clang-format.tar.xz'</code></li>
<li>Extract the tar file
<code>tar xvfJ clang-format/clang-format.tar.xz -C ./clang-format</code></li>
<li>Remove any previously sym-linked linked version you have
<code>rm -f ~/bin/clang-format</code></li>
<li>Link the downloaded clang-format command into our <code>~/bin</code> folder
<code>ln -s $(pwd)/$(find clang-format | grep bin/clang-format$) ~/bin/clang-format</code></li>
<li>Test the command works
<code>clang-format --help</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Here are all of the steps above as a script:</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf ./clang-<span class="hljs-keyword">format</span>/ &amp;&amp; mkdir -p ./clang-<span class="hljs-keyword">format</span>
curl <span class="hljs-string">'http://llvm.org/releases/3.5.0/clang+llvm-3.5.0-macosx-apple-darwin.tar.xz'</span> -o <span class="hljs-string">'./clang-format/clang-format.tar.xz'</span>
tar xvfJ clang-<span class="hljs-keyword">format</span>/clang-<span class="hljs-keyword">format</span>.tar.xz -C ./clang-<span class="hljs-keyword">format</span>
rm -f ~/bin/clang-<span class="hljs-keyword">format</span>
ln -s <span class="hljs-variable">$(</span><span class="hljs-keyword">pwd</span>)/<span class="hljs-variable">$(</span>find clang-<span class="hljs-keyword">format</span> | grep bin/clang-<span class="hljs-keyword">format</span><span class="hljs-variable">$)</span> ~/bin/clang-<span class="hljs-keyword">format</span>
clang-<span class="hljs-keyword">format</span> --<span class="hljs-keyword">help</span>
</code></pre>
<h1>How to setup your project style guide</h1>
<p>Now that you have the command line <code>clang-format</code> tool installed, you can walk through how to use it to format our Objective-C code files. Let's walk through some steps I used to apply a standard code format to the project.</p>
<p>But, before you use the command line tool to rip through our project, let's first set the standards you'd like clang-format to adhere to when formatting our code.</p>
<p>At the root of your project (probably where your <code>.git</code> folder is), create a file called <code>.clang-format</code></p>
<p>The <code>.clang-format</code> file contains the formatting rules for a project. Its structure is <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> and is what the <code>clang-format</code> CLI can read to format your project's Objective-C files.</p>
<p>For details about the <code>.clang-format</code> file, you can <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html">check out the docs</a> to get a list of all of the options possible in this file.</p>
<p>Here is one I have used before.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">BasedOnStyle</span>: <span class="hljs-string">Chromium</span>

<span class="http"><span class="hljs-attribute">AlignTrailingComments</span>: <span class="hljs-string">true</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">AllowShortIfStatementsOnASingleLine</span>: <span class="hljs-string">false</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">BreakBeforeBraces</span>: <span class="hljs-string">Attach</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">ColumnLimit</span>: <span class="hljs-string">0</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">IndentWidth</span>: <span class="hljs-string">4</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">KeepEmptyLinesAtTheStartOfBlocks</span>: <span class="hljs-string">true</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">Language</span>: <span class="hljs-string">Cpp</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">MaxEmptyLinesToKeep</span>: <span class="hljs-string">4</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">ObjCSpaceAfterProperty</span>: <span class="hljs-string">true</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">ObjCSpaceBeforeProtocolList</span>: <span class="hljs-string">false</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">PointerBindsToType</span>: <span class="hljs-string">false</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">SpacesBeforeTrailingComments</span>: <span class="hljs-string">1</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">TabWidth</span>: <span class="hljs-string">4</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">UseTab</span>: <span class="hljs-string">Never</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you want to ignore a folder from being touched, you can place a <code>.clang-format</code> in that folder with the following option set:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">BasedOnStyle</span>: <span class="hljs-string">None</span>
</code></pre>
<h1>Format all our files at once</h1>
<p>Now that you have a <code>.clang-format</code> file which helps to define our project's styling conventions, you can begin our initial formatting sweep.</p>
<p>First let's create a command that gives us all the files you want to process.</p>
<p>Here's my initial example (executed in a zsh shell):</p>
<p><code>ls MyProject/*.[hm]</code></p>
<p>Tweak this however you need so that you get a list of files to format from your project. You may want to be careful to exclude a CocoaPods folder, or other third party libraries and once you are happy with it, you can then pipe its output to <code>clang-format</code>.</p>
<p><code>ls MyProject/*.[hm] | xargs clang-format -i -style=file</code></p>
<p>You can use the <code>xargs</code> command to execute the <code>clang-format</code> command for each file in the output <code>ls</code>.</p>
<h3><code>clang-format</code> options</h3>
<p>In the above example you use the following <code>clang-format</code> options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-i</code> tells it to do an in-place edit of the file</li>
<li><code>style=file</code> this tells <code>clang-format</code> to use our <code>.clang-format</code> style rules when formatting.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Did you have your project under source control before doing this?</h1>
<p>I sure hope you have the project in source control. You should now be able to <code>git diff</code> or whatever you do to view your source changes and see the files that have been modified by the <code>clang-format</code> command.</p>
<p>I hope this post was helpful in showing you how to install <code>clang-format</code> and use it to format your existing Objective-C project.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><h1>TL;DR</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary I left my Octopress blog behind quite a while ago, and this site has been statically generated with a custom tooling build up around gulpjs and node.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Some of the details...</h1>
<p>After I <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2014/04/migrating-blogspot-to-octopress-part-1-introduction/">migrated from Blogspot to Octopress</a> I started running into workflow issues and <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/2226">other issues</a> that turned me off from Octopress/Jekyll (at least for my own site).</p>
<p>It was also right around the time that <a href="http://gulpjs.com">GulpJS</a> came out and I needed a project to play around with...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I did what every developer does. I wrote my own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/approvals/Approvals.NodeJS">Approvals.NodeJS</a> to capture previous renderings of the Octopress generated version of <a href="http://staxmanade.com">staxmanade.com</a>, I was surprised at how quickly I ported my Octopress generated site to a new custom static site generator.</p>
<p>I'm not writing this to convince you to leave Octopress for anything (especially <a href="http://togglejs.github.io">my home-grown tool</a>), but felt compelled to get a blog post out describing some of the cool little features I've implemented.</p>
<h2>Personal struggles with Octopress:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Octopress site generation was too SLOW for me. There's even a helper rake task that moves your posts to a temporary folder to exclude from generation when you want to quickly see the post you're working on generate fast, but this just bothered me from a fundamental level.</li>
<li>I'm not a Ruby developer and don't have the ability or desire to fork/maintain Jekyll or Octopress. I wanted to have something that I pretty much owned. (yea - that comes with a larger maintenance burden, but meh - I'm a developer and its part of the process)</li>
<li>Disliked that every time I <code>rake gen_deploy</code> I didn't know the exact code-diff that was changed since the previous version. I'd like to know exactly what files have changed and how they have changed before they get deployed. (again, there's probably a solution here, but didn't really care to dig deeper)</li>
<li>There's an issue on Windows where you end up mucking around with the <a href="http://www.tomordonez.com/blog/2014/07/30/installing-octopress-in-windows-server/">codepage</a>, which made working on things a bit of a headache.</li>
</ul>
<h1>So what did I end up with?</h1>
<p>I now have a statically generated site all powered by <code>gulp</code> and a small library/command line tool I've thrown up here: <a href="http://togglejs.github.io/">Togglejs</a>.</p>
<h1>How is this better ~err~ different?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Regenerating my site only takes about 6 seconds (as opposed to the Octopress 30+)</li>
<li>I learned <a href="http://gulpjs.com">gulp</a>, and <a href="http://node.js">node.js</a> streams along the way.</li>
<li>Built by myself — which was a good for the learning experience.</li>
<li>Don't have to set the codepage to <code>65001</code> for Windows machines.</li>
<li>Series support.
<ul>
<li>I've implemented two different features for supporting a series. One allows me to control through YAML front matter posts and how they tie into a series topic. Another feature allows me to write out a series in a single markdown file, where I can specify a delimiter to split the articles up by. I may blog more about these in the future as they're a feature I've quite liked and was relatively easy to implement using my custom site generator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Easy post tagging for a custom feed that gets cross-posted to <a href="http://elegantcode.com">elegantcode.com</a></li>
<li>The <a href="http://togglejs.github.io/">tog</a> is easy to extend with custom commands and has a number of pre-built commands already ready to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I've not put a huge amount of time into it - and I haven't exactly developed it to be a competitor to Octopress or other static site generators, it pretty much has just what I need it to have at the moment and not really anything more.</p>
<h1>How is this worse?</h1>
<ul>
<li>I have to maintain it (this is both a blessing and a curse) - don't get the benefits of bug fixes by hundreds of contributors to Octopress.</li>
<li>I haven't yet ditched the Octopress theme, so that change will be coming at some point.</li>
<li>I don't have any automated process to deploying changes. So I can't just create a post on my phone, save to my repo and expect it to automatically show up online - but have ideas on how to do that.</li>
<li>My <code>gulp watch</code> is not working correctly and it's not yet wired up to <code>livereload</code> which would be a nice next step...</li>
</ul>
<h1>BUT...</h1>
<p>This is my site so it's all up to me to make it right...</p>
<p>It's been a pleasure to build this up and just a fun little project to hack on (as if all the <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/">other OSS projects</a> I hack on aren't enough).</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>How to setup git to allow different merge/diff tools based on file extension.</p>
<p>I'm going to put this here so I can find it later...</p>
<h1>Create a merge-wrapper script</h1>
<p>To allow us the flexibility we want to determine which diff tool should be used for different file extensions, we need to break out the logic in to an external script. Below I have 2 samples of a merge script. I started with the <code>.sh</code> file (bottom), but changed over to the <code>.js</code> version (above that) since it is easier for me to maintain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I haven't yet tried to run this on windows, but suspect we can wrap the <code>merge-wrapper.js</code> in a <code>.cmd</code> file calling it with <a href="http://Node.JS">Node.JS</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Customize the <code>merge-wrapper.js</code></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Extend with other diff tool support:</p>
<p>If you want to extend the script to add support for your own diff tool, just create a new function that returns an object following the pattern of the existing <code>createP4MergeCommand</code> or <code>createOpenDiffCommand</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify which diff tool is used per extension:</p>
<p>If you want to change which tool is used per file extensions you can modify the <code>diffLookup</code> hash to map various extensions to whatever tool you setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave me a comment (either here - or in the gist) of what diff tool you added.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to take contributions of other diff tools in this gist if you leave a comment with yours...</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/69db226ae58bdce518cb.js?file=%3Ca%20href%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fmerge-wrapper.js%22%3Emerge-wrapper.js%3C%2Fa%3E"></script></p>
<p>Below was an attempt at using a bash script to manage what I do above, it'll work for some, but I didn't want to maintain this - prefer the JS version instead.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/69db226ae58bdce518cb.js?file=%3Ca%20href%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fmerge-wrapper.sh%22%3Emerge-wrapper.sh%3C%2Fa%3E"></script></p>
<h1>Setup <code>~/.gitconfig</code></h1>
<p>Now that we've created our merge wrapper script we need to tell git how to use it.</p>
<p>Say we placed our merge script in the following directory: <code>$HOME/dotfiles/tools/merge-wrapper.js</code>. You can add the below to your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file and when you use <code>git difftool</code> our new merge-wrapper will be used to pick diff tools based on file extension.</p>
<pre><code>[merge]
    tool = merge_wrapper
[mergetool <span class="hljs-string">"merge_wrapper"</span>]
    cmd = <span class="hljs-variable">$HOME</span>/dotfiles/tools/merge-wrapper.js \<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$BASE</span>\"</span> \<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$LOCAL</span>\"</span> \<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$REMOTE</span>\"</span> \<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$MERGED</span>\"</span>
</code></pre>

<div class="entry-content"><h1><a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/skypeit">SkypeIt</a></h1>
<p>In short <code>npm install -g skypeit</code> and enjoy quickly jumping on conference calls.</p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>A simple little command line utility that can be used to efficiently jump on a conference call and automatically dials the extension or conference ID.</p>
<h1>What pain does this solve?</h1>
<p>I've recently been working on a number of projects where often times more than twice a day I have to jump on a conference bridge.</p>
<p>This typically involves:</p>
<ol>
<li>Opening the Outlook appointment</li>
<li>Copying just the conference phone number (without extension)</li>
<li>Pasting it in Skype to dial</li>
<li>While Skype is dialing, I go back to Outlook and copy the extension/conference id.</li>
<li>Pasting in Skype's number pad area</li>
<li>Type or use the mouse to press the final <code>#</code> key.</li>
</ol>
<h1>How does <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/skypeit">SkypeIt</a> improve this?</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/skypeit">SkypeIt</a> takes the 6 steps and cuts them in half or more.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Outlook appointment</li>
<li>Copy the conference phone number &amp; extension (if there is one) in one shot.</li>
<li>At the (already open command line - because we developers usually have a command line open) paste in <code>skypeit &quot;&lt;paste here&gt;&quot; &lt;press enter&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The problem this solves may seem like a first world problem, but a big annoyance factor when running through the original steps to get on a conference call is, people who setup these meetings, rarely include the final <code>#</code> sign needed at the end of a conference ID/extension #. So when I paste the extension into Skype, I still have to manually get the <code>#</code> in there.</p>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/skypeit">SkypeIt</a> even better with teams!</h1>
<p>If you <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2014/12/thoughts-on-working-remotely-from-home/">work remotely as I do</a>, then you're probably communicating through things like HipChat, Skype, Slack, AOL (I-kid, I-kid), etc. Instead of I.M.ing your team to remind them to jump on a call where they would have to repeat the long steps above, you can just paste the <code>skypeIt ###-###-### ######</code> command necessary to immediately jump on a call. This serves to remind them a call is coming up or already started and saves time from having to find the number/extension as they can copy/paste it directly at the command line.</p>
<p>Or even better, if you're on a Mac and using ZSH at the command line, SkypeIt has tab completion support and a YAML config strategy, so you can easily configure a project with your standard phone numbers (say daily standup conference number) and check in a <code>.skypeitrc</code> file to the project. When you're in the context of the project you can just type <code>skypeit stand&lt;tab&gt;</code> and jump on your daily standup conference call.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does anyone who works remotely actually stand-up on a daily standup call? hmmm...</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Still early...</h1>
<p>SkypeIt was written to solve a personal pain-point and is not yet a complete solution for all conference call situations. If you'd like to see your scenario supported, head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/skypeit/issues">SkypeIt Issues</a> on GitHub and drop me a line.</p>
<p>I'm not currently using a windows machine - but with the windows protocol activation capabilities, we can probably easily add support for windows to <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/skypeit">SkypeIt</a>.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
<p>This post may seem a bit longer than my usual posts. It's one I've slowly been extending over the last couple years while working remotely. Many of the points may be obvious ones, but if you're considering a work-from-home (remotely) type of position that you consider some of these topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>My previous job afforded me the opportunity to work from home a couple days out of the week. While putting my wife through school, those days were great. I would start work extra early so I could leave early and watch our little girl while my wife headed off to class. The early start was great because these quiet mornings were often the most productive part of my day. The lack of distractions such as email, meetings, and instant message chats along with the quiet focus time all contributed to this increased productivity.</p>
<p>While I quite enjoyed this time, was often productive, and it helped my family I still preferred to go into the office over working from home.</p>
<p>So why did I still prefer going to the office over working from home?</p>
<p>I did not feel as connected to the group, which left me feeling as thought I was always playing catchup. All of those water-cooler discussions and inpromptu office meetings where I (or anyone else remote) wasn't pulled into more often not left me feeling like I was not able to keep on top of what was going on.</p>
<p>This experience and the feeling it left me with is what concerned me about the new job I was about to take.</p>
<h1>Worried to take a remote / work from home job.</h1>
<p>Given my limited work from home experience, I was concerned about working remotely 100% of the time. However, the new opportunity to work for a <a href="http://vertigo.com">consulting firm I admired,</a> and the thought of being able to constantly try new technologies, and business domains was really appealing.</p>
<p>I have now worked remotely for Vertigo for over 3 years and I'd like to share a list of Pros/Cons that I've gathered through my experience working from home full time.</p>
<h1>Con's to working from home</h1>
<p>Now, while Con's do not outweigh the Pro's for me, there is quite a bit of grey area here, so let's review some con's.</p>
<ul>
<li>Less human/social interaction on a daily basis. As an introvert, and a software developer, this is generally not too bad. This was a bigger concern for me originally and is much less of an issue now that I've tried it out. I make sure to take some time to have great Skype video calls with fellow remote coworkers and I also try to offset this by participating in local user groups or and other social occasions. However, the best medicine for this is a simple trip to the park with my little girls. I will say that I've had a day or two where I jumped at the opportunity to take a trip to Costco or other errand just so I could get out of the house...</li>
<li>Shipping Hardware.
<ul>
<li>This one is a bit of a pain. Working for a consulting firm means there are many of different projects that require varying hardware configurations. From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NFXON1Q/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00NFXON1Q&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=staxmanadecom-20&amp;linkId=EL5GYMNM3KI4HBGO">Xboxes</a>, test phones, tablets, computers, and even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I7JZNIU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00I7JZNIU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=staxmanadecom-20&amp;linkId=3SZPKBVY7VEVBMO7">TVs</a>. I semi-regularly run to FedEx and send something to H.Q. or the Apple Store or Best Buy to pick up some hardware based on the needs of a project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It can be a little too easy to sit at the personal computer in the evening and reach over to my work computer to reply to a late work-related email, or hammer on some code. So you need to be careful about the work/family balance when it's so easy to work from home. This takes a bit of discipline.</li>
<li>Sitting in the office chair when the amazingly yummy aromas of some fresh home cooking - distracting me from being productive as the smell is driving my stomach to scream at me to go downstairs for some food!</li>
<li>Communication
<ul>
<li>Being remote, you have to become an over-communicator. An email here and there is fine, but combine that with chat/I.M., phone calls, video chat calls (preferred), and more emails. However, you have to work a little harder to be noticed, especially if you have to compete with people who are all working in the same office.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It often takes a little more discipline to take breaks.</li>
<li>Time Zones
<ul>
<li>Time Zones are a hassle from many different angles, even when you work at an office; however, working remotely often means your employer has hired you because you are not near them. This increases the chance that you are several or more timezones away from your company's headquarters. Which can mean the usual things like meal planning, start/stop times, etc require a bit more planning and accommodation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Pro's to working from home</h1>
<ul>
<li>Home office temperature!
<ul>
<li>Like most indoor jobs, AC and Heat are good amenities to have, but in big buildings people cannot often control the temperature. It's either too cold or too hot as big buildings have a mind of their own (their airflow and ventilation kinks). However, working from home, you're the <strong>master of your indoor weather</strong>. If you get hot, take off some clothes or turn on the AC. If you're too cold, put on some clothes or crank up the heat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commute
<ul>
<li>I often joke with my fellow Californian commute ridden co-workers when they complain about traffic that day that I narrowly avoided a 3 (lego) car pile-up on my way to the office.</li>
<li>I live where it's cold in the winter and not having to scrape the ice off of the windshield of my car in the morning due to the icy dew is a HUGE benefit.</li>
<li>Plus there's the, well not commuting part. While I enjoyed using the commute to zone out to my <a href="http://staxmanade.com/about/podcasts.html">favorite podcasts</a>, I still find time to keep up with my podcast when doing things like laundry, dishes, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More family time overall. Since my coffee, water, bathroom breaks all lead to opportunities where I can say hello to the family.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GLLVH72/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00GLLVH72&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=staxmanadecom-20&amp;linkId=FCMDP27PBQTYHNTS">SWEATPANTS!</a> My wife recently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GLLVH72/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00GLLVH72&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=staxmanadecom-20&amp;linkId=FCMDP27PBQTYHNTS">introduced me to sweatpants</a>. OMG they are comfortable, try wearing those at the stuffy-formal-office...</li>
<li>Quiet place to focus. It's easy to isolate yourself from the outside world if you need some quiet time to focus and be productive. Shut off the I.M., put phone on do not disturb, close email and get some serious work done.</li>
<li>We have all the usual necessities at home,
<ul>
<li>Tools (for that time you need a screwdriver)</li>
<li>Easy access to hygiene related products/tools. Ever need to take a shower in the middle of the day? Change of clothes (spilled coffee....)? Or brush your teeth?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Invest in your office.
<ul>
<li>When you invest in your home office, you're investing in yourself. Get a good chair, desk, keyboard, mouse, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lunch at home. My wife is a great cook. I'm spoiled to nearly always have a great set of leftovers in the fridge. Keeping me from eating out all the time. Not having to worry about someone eating my leftover chicken-wings (ya, that really happened - not even funny - You know who you are!)</li>
<li>My wife just brought me the most amazing homemade burrito. I didn't even care I was on a video call with my team. nom...nom...nom...</li>
<li>One of my favorite perks, is not even a perk that any company could offer (or even replace). I take the opportunity to for 10-minute break in the afternoon, where I walk up the street to meet my daughter at the bus stop. This is so much more important in my life than practically any company can offer (like free lunches, ping-pong table, etc...).</li>
<li>Scheduling an at-home call is easy. It's rarely a problem to have a fix-it man come by, or cable-guy, or if a package needs to be signed for, working from home makes this easy.</li>
<li>David's Additions: I shared a draft of this post to a <a href="http://t3rse.com/">good friend and coworker</a> and he gave me some other tips, I hadn't thought of, which I totally agree.
<ul>
<li>You struggle on problems and your kid walks in the room and puts your life in perspective.</li>
<li>I can listen to my music turned way up!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>What about distractions?</h1>
<p>I get this a lot, when I tell others I work from home. &quot;I don't know how you don't get distracted with other things to do at home.&quot; This may be a very individual thing. While, there can be distractions at home, I've always been a focused individual and I would say it's often easier to be distracted at the office with office chit-chat, meetings, going out to lunch, etc.</p>
<h1>Not-so socially appropriate</h1>
<ul>
<li>When you're at the office, possibly in a long meeting, what do you do if you have some gas? Working remotely, there's no stress, or stomach pain... Mute your conference call, relax and nobody is the wiser. (Except this one time, I did such a thing not realizing my wife was within an earshot. Yea, a bit embarrassing but we had a laugh over it.)</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content"><h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>Respond to emails with <strong>got it</strong>. Or some context-related reply, for example: <strong>thanks</strong> or <strong>will respond with further detail later...</strong></p>
<h1>More Context</h1>
<p>We all know that communication is important, and often where things go awry.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if I'm alone in this thinking, but don't think I am. When I send an important email, I like to know that the person on the other end received it. It may be an email that will take the other person time to respond with the detail necessary, but it's awfully unproductive to send an email, and wait  a day or two before finding out that the communication was never received.</p>
<p>Simply replying with <strong>got it</strong> or <strong>got it, will respond with more detail later...</strong> is a great way to notify me that you've received the email (and may take some time to respond).</p>
<p>I don't necessarily care that my email takes priority, but at least knowing that the other end has seen it is 1/2 the battle.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><h1>How to update a git branch OTHER than the one you're currently on.</h1>
<pre><code>git branch -f {branch-to-change} {commit-to-change-to}
</code></pre>
<p>I recently setup a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">C.I.</a> server to automatically generate builds of an iOS application and upload to <a href="http://testflightapp.com/">TestFlight</a>. I don't want each and every push to master to trigger a new TestFlight build, so I configured my C.I. server to watch the <code>release</code> branch.</p>
<p>I was starting to dislike the switch branch dance to trigger a new build.</p>
<h3>What I used to do:</h3>
<pre><code># When I was on the master branch
git checkout release
git merge master
git push
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>When things start to hurt, look for a better alternative. And with Git, there is almost always a more efficient way.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>After digging a bit, I found the answer.</h3>
<pre><code>git branch -f {branch-to-change} {commit-to-change-to}
</code></pre>
<p>So to trigger a new build from master I can just:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -f release master
git push origin release
</code></pre>
<p>Or wrap that in a <a href="http://gulpjs.com">Gulp</a> task <code>gulp tf</code>. And with <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/CommandAllThings">CommandAllThings</a> I can now type <code>rake tf</code>, or <code>grunt tf</code> or <code>gulp tf</code> and they all trigger a new build to come out of TestFlight.</p>
<p>Or if you wanted to skip moving your local branch, you could just update the remote branch directly.</p>
<pre><code>git push origin local_branch:remote_branch
</code></pre>
<p>So my workflow would look more like</p>
<pre><code>git push origin master:release
</code></pre>
<p>Happy Automation!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I'd like to introduce a simple little tool/(set of scripts) I threw together last weekend called <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/CommandAllThings">CommandAllThings</a>.</p>
<h1>Some background</h1>
<p>Do you use any command line build tools like <a href="http://gulpjs.com">GulpJS</a>, <a href="http://gruntjs.com">GruntJS</a>, <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a>, etc?</p>
<p>I leverage these tools in many projects, both at work and on my own projects. I recently noticed that the muscle memory I've developed was slowing me down as I switch between projects and inadvertently use the wrong tool in the wrong project.</p>
<p>When working on one project all day and typing <code>rake test</code> throughout the day, then switching to another project not using <code>rake</code> I found myself still typing <code>rake test</code> even though I needed to type <code>gulp test</code>, or <code>grunt build</code>. This really messes with my flow. All I wanted to do was <code>test</code> or <code>build</code> the current project.</p>
<p>So I created <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/CommandAllThings">CommandAllThings</a>.</p>
<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>In short, it's a very simple abstraction on top of your usual task runners like <a href="http://gulpjs.com">GulpJS</a>, <a href="http://gruntjs.com">GruntJS</a>, <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">rake</a>, etc that allows you to accidentally type the wrong tool and still accomplish the desired task with the right tool.</p>
<p>By using aliases in either PowerShell or Bash we can route, <code>rake</code>, <code>gulp</code>, <code>grunt</code>, etc to <code>CommandAllThings</code> which will inspect the current directory, determine the correct tool and execute your task(s) with the correct tool.</p>
<p>This is great. Now when I type in the wrong command <code>rake test</code> in a <code>gulp</code> project, I don't get slapped in the face with an error saying &quot;cannot find a rakefile.&quot; Instead I continue on my way like I knew what I was doing.</p>

<h1>Does it only work on Windows or on the Mac?</h1>
<p>At the moment it works on both.</p>
<ul>
<li>For Windows I have an implementation in Powershell.</li>
<li>For the Mac you can alias to a Bash script.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Download at GitHub!</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/CommandAllThings">Check it out!</a></p>
<h1>What's next?</h1>
<p>I'd like to look at adding other tools to the list. You can check out the project for other task runners I know about. And if you have any thoughts on how to detect the other types, drop me a note in the issues (or consider sending over a pull request).</p>
<p>I'd also love to get some feedback on how to best or more easily get this into peoples's development environment. For now it's pretty manual and since it's all about your profile, a bit personal, so probably a good thing that it's not automatically installed.</p>
<p>Happy Commanding!</p>
