Part 1 Why</a>. It is a great read into the subject, covering many of problems other source control methods introduce and how the Branch-Per-Feature concept alleviates some of these issues. It is also great to see a how it can be used in relation to a Kanban style of development. I look forward to his further posts about some of the details of this process with subversion. </p>  <p>While waiting for those posts, I thought I’d write up some of the things my team and I have learned while implementing a semi-Kanban process using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx">Team Foundation Server (TFS)</a>.</p>  <p>We practiced a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)">scrum</a> like agile process for about 3 years with a fair amount of success. However, about 4 months ago we hit the end of a very long “Sprint” (6 weeks). There were at least 3 major “features” built during this sprint and we also determined that since were going to be developing several large features, we would also take the time to upgrade our database server, since we would inherently, through the development time, be able to do a little database regression testing.</p>  <p>During the retrospective for this sprint there developed a couple themes revolving around </p>  <ol>   <li>Size and number of features developed made testing in the allotted sprint time difficult to complete each feature thoroughly. </li>    <li>The features developed at the beginning of the sprint were developed and tested very thoroughly, </li>    <li>The features developed near the end of the sprint felt rushed and resulted in some choices making some choices that may not have left the code </li>    <li>Upgrading a to a new database version AND deploying all these new features threw too many things in the mix for one deployment. </li>    <li>The items developed first sat behind the development firewall for in one case over 3 weeks, when that feature could have given the business value 3 weeks prior. </li> </ol>  <p>Our transition to Kanban was somewhat sudden. I had been reading kanban as a tool for delivering software for a couple months. I thought that many of the issues we were having with scrum could be resolved with a simple Kanban process. So I brought up the idea of doing “feature driven development” during the retrospective. What came as a shock to me was the welcoming the team gave this new idea. I had been thinking about how to bring the idea up for some time, and couldn’t imagine how the team would want to make the drastic change that this new style of development would require. After talking about it for a short time during this retrospective, just about everyone on the team seemed to jump all over the idea.</p>  <p>The team decided right then that we would give it a try for a while, work out the kinks, learn from it, and see how it would go.</p>  <p>When we first created our kanban, there was a much simpler pipeline of stages than the list I will outline as our current process. Most blogs/articles basically described starting with something simple like (Backlog, Dev, Test, Deploy). So we started with those very simple steps and it has been refined for our process.</p>  <p>We continued to value the retrospective and through this constant reflection were able to very quickly fine tune our process to something that, looking back, is really suiting us well.</p>  <p>We have been using the new approach for 4 months now and haven’t looked back. Some of the original things that the team was worried about when moving to the Branch-Per-Feature have all but washed away. In particular, <strong>one of the largest concerns everyone on the team had was the overhead branching and merging would bring into the process</strong>. <strong>And while it is a little bit more overhead than just opening the solution and pounding away, it brings many more benefits to the team than we loose in branching/merging time.</strong></p>  <p>In the next part I’ll describe the kanban stages our team has ironed out and how we mix that with the Branching-Per-Feature development.</p></div>

<p>I’ve been programming against the .net framework since the late beta of version 1.0 came out. (I had a couple year hiatus when I took a job doing some Linux &amp; C++) however, suffice it to say, I’ve been using the language a long time. I still find it amazing that there are features in the language that have been a round a long time and still manage stumbling across things I’ve never seen before.</p>  <p>Today’s newly learned feature I saw in a blog by <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/">bogardj</a> over at <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/">LostTechies</a> where he wrote up a little <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2009/06/24/expressions-cheat-sheet.aspx">Expressions Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>  <p>In his blog, I notice the “checked” keyword had the blue syntax highlighting. (which usually means it’s a C# keyword)</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SkTfB5ivx2I/AAAAAAAAAJI/DZYX6HqutGM/s1600-h/image%5B4%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SkTfCEOcaGI/AAAAAAAAAJM/bjFimfVqmxE/image_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="602" height="365" /></a> </p>  <p>So, to verify, I copied the word into my C# editor and what do you know… It is a C# keyword. This is probably something most if not all C# programmers out there already know and I, for some reason have missed this.</p>  <p>Here’s a blurb about it on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9033/hidden-features-of-c/355991#355991">stack overflow “Hidden features of C#”</a>.<a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SkTfCQOXVZI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/36Bi7s0yXzs/s1600-h/image%5B10%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SkTfCnzkBdI/AAAAAAAAAJU/RLV3BvPXhTE/image_thumb%5B6%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="605" height="220" /></a> </p>  <p>And of course you can get the official details @ <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/74b4xzyw(VS.71).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/74b4xzyw(VS.71).aspx</a></p>  <p>I decided to explore this a little. As an academic exercise I wanted to see what the difference would be between using the checked keyword with a cast operation and compare that to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.convert.tobyte.aspx">System.Convert.ToByte</a> operation.    <br /><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SkTfCw76XwI/AAAAAAAAAJY/rZ0k6Ds3CRI/s1600-h/image%5B14%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SkTfDFmC4II/AAAAAAAAAJc/CoUMfycJ3do/image_thumb%5B8%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="554" height="128" /></a>    <br />Will generate the following error. <strong>System.OverflowException : Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow.</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SkTfDRuVKAI/AAAAAAAAAJg/XsG2SQcPABU/s1600-h/image%5B25%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SkTfDjOy0lI/AAAAAAAAAJk/itMzHCCsv5w/image_thumb%5B13%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="610" height="120" /></a>    <br />While using the System.Convert class will generate a different error. <strong>System.OverflowException : Value was either too large or too small for an unsigned byte.</strong>&#160;</p>  <p>And last experiment I threw both of the conversion attempts in a loop and fired up the <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_performance_profiler/index.htm">ANTS Profiler</a> which shows that using the built in <font color="#0000ff">checked</font> keyword with a cast operation is faster than using the BCL conversion.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SkTfD-trbyI/AAAAAAAAAJo/iZm-skTI2ok/s1600-h/image%5B37%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SkTfENFFsPI/AAAAAAAAAJs/FWkJX2oo1ws/image_thumb%5B19%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="609" height="324" /></a>&#160;</p>  <p>As to which one is better I would probably have to dig deeper into other side affects that one may have over the other… Up front I don’t see any issue with the cast and checked keyword combo.</p>  </div>

Good to know. Actually I did know about it but I think I had it backwards, I thought that it was checked by default and therefore the keyword was only useful if used in an explicitly unchecked block. Your tests here seem to disprove that, so thanks for the info.</div>

Haven’t taken the time to create a binary release, but should be able to get latest build, execute the build.Silverlight.cmd and in the drops\Current-Silverlight should be Moq.Contrib.UnityAutoMocker.Silverlight.dll</p>  <p>Enjoy!</p>  </div>

What I ended up figuring out, was how to change the icon for a running console window.</p>  <p>It’s actually pretty easy… Here is the class I wrote and use.</p>  <pre><span style="color: #0000ff">internal</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">class</span> ConsoleIconSwapper : IDisposable<br />{<br />    IntPtr consoleWindowHwnd;<br /><br />    <span style="color: #0000ff">private</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">const</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">int</span> WM_SETICON = 0x80;	<span style="color: #008000">// Api constant</span><br />    <span style="color: #0000ff">private</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">const</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">int</span> ICON_SMALL = 0;	<span style="color: #008000">// Api constant</span><br /><br />    [DllImport(&quot;<span style="color: #8b0000">user32.dll</span>&quot;)]<br />    <span style="color: #0000ff">private</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">static</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">extern</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">int</span> SendMessage(IntPtr hwnd, <span style="color: #0000ff">int</span> message, <span style="color: #0000ff">int</span> wParam, IntPtr lParam);<br /><br />    [DllImport(&quot;<span style="color: #8b0000">kernel32</span>&quot;)]<br />    <span style="color: #0000ff">private</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">static</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">extern</span> IntPtr GetConsoleWindow();<br /><br />    <span style="color: #0000ff">public</span> ConsoleIconSwapper()<br />    {<br />        consoleWindowHwnd = GetConsoleWindow();<br />    }<br /><br />    <span style="color: #0000ff">public</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">void</span> ShowConsoleIcon(Icon icon)<br />    {<br />        SendMessage(consoleWindowHwnd, WM_SETICON, ICON_SMALL, icon.Handle);<br />    }<br /><br />    <span style="color: #0000ff">public</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">void</span> ChangeIconback()<br />    {<br />        SendMessage(consoleWindowHwnd, WM_SETICON, ICON_SMALL, (IntPtr)0);<br />    }<br /><br />    <span style="color: #0000ff">public</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">void</span> Dispose()<br />    {<br />        ChangeIconback();<br />    }<br />}</pre><br /><br /><p>And here is how I use it.</p><br /><br /><pre><span style="color: #0000ff">using</span> (var consoleIconSwapper = <span style="color: #0000ff">new</span> ConsoleIconSwapper())<br />{<br />    consoleIconSwapper.ShowConsoleIcon(CoreResources.FavIcon);<br />    <span style="color: #008000">/*<br />     *  Code Here<br />     */</span><br />}</pre><br /><br /><p>This is what it looks like when in use…</p><br /><br /><p>Before:<a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SgZ4p24wrvI/AAAAAAAAAIA/jrcqzHB68ek/s1600-h/image%5B21%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SgZ4qKHQ1wI/AAAAAAAAAIE/37QrEplXSvs/image_thumb%5B9%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="175" height="32" /></a><br /><br />  <br />During:<a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SgZ4qaSofLI/AAAAAAAAAII/gD57RvvY0QM/s1600-h/image%5B22%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SgZ4qswfXEI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/WQoqtYfLgLo/image_thumb%5B10%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="162" height="48" /></a> <br /><br />  <br />After:<a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SgZ4q51vbkI/AAAAAAAAAIY/tM64Vif9A04/s1600-h/image%5B25%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SgZ4rAQeMhI/AAAAAAAAAIg/UrpNW9pDftU/image_thumb%5B13%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="175" height="32" /></a></p><br /><br /><p>Amused by simple things :)</p>  </div>

Hi Jason,<br /><br />I tried to reproduce this bug in SSMS 2008 (10.0.5500.0), and the Connect option is disabled while the new query window is initializing. Looks like it&#39;s fixed to me.<br /><br />Please can you verify.<br />Thanks<br />Andy</div>

<p>My company has been developing out parts of our website using <a href="http://silverlight.com/" target="_blank">Silverlight</a> to enable some rich client LOB scenarios. Since the companies inception, we developed in a Scrum/Agile manner 3-6 week iterations. However, recently we started experimenting with a more “feature driven” attempt at “lean” approach. </p>  <p>With this new development approach, we made the decision that the trunk of the project’s source will be ready to deploy to production at all times. And as such would develop features out on branches. This is where the problem lies… We started running into a <a href="http://troyfarrell.com/blog/post/Maximum-file-path-length---Windows-and-TFS.aspx" target="_blank">“Maximum file path length…”</a> issue when branching the source. It’s a relatively old project (5 years or so now) with layers of projects/namespaces. </p>  <p>We traced the issue down to files generated by the Visual Studio’s Add Service Reference dialog.    <br /><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/Sd_UnpimHkI/AAAAAAAAAF4/2Pzl6l7mgD4/s1600-h/image%5B2%5D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="202" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/Sd_Un_Ie61I/AAAAAAAAAF8/jRJOfQb0rNI/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="244" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/Sd_UoJFQQoI/AAAAAAAAAGA/WvFyDYrCkKk/s1600-h/image%5B5%5D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="188" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/Sd_UoYBaSGI/AAAAAAAAAGE/p6ei3NVsi20/image_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>In our case the generated files had the full namespace + service name which were, in some cases, greater than 90 characters long just for the file. Coupled with the fact they were already nested in a directory structure (that helped keep things organized). We ended bumping into the <a href="http://troyfarrell.com/blog/post/Maximum-file-path-length---Windows-and-TFS.aspx" target="_blank">“Maximum file path length…”</a> when trying to branch the project.</p>  <p>After researching a hunch I’d had</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Most of those files generated by the tool are garbage and never used, so why does VS generate them, and have to check them into TFS?</p>    <p>Here’s a good post describing the meta data files.     <br /><a href="http://www.scottseely.com/blog/09-01-26/Misunderstood_Add_Service_Reference.aspx">http://www.scottseely.com/blog/09-01-26/Misunderstood_Add_Service_Reference.aspx</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>I found out that the only thing we cared about was the “References.cs” file in that whole batch of files.</p>  <p>Now, we would like to, and have thought about writing our own code in place of using the VS generated, (I know I’ve heard from the WCF pros at <a href="http://www.idesign.net/" target="_blank">IDesign</a> that you should never use the “Add Service Reference” generated stuff…) however it does what we need with the exception of the super long file names generated and…every time we update the service reference it keeps trying to add the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig back into the project. Since we are not using a config file to store the WCF connection information. We are following a similar path you can read about here (<a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/mwatson/archive/2009/02/24/129655.aspx">http://geekswithblogs.net/mwatson/archive/2009/02/24/129655.aspx</a>) This way we don’t have to have separate configs for Dev/Test/Production. </p>  <p>The built in VS Service Reference tooling has become more of a hindrance to development than providing any benefit.</p>  <h4>What is the solution we came up with to these two issues?</h4>  <blockquote>   <p>What were the problems again?</p>    <p>1. Files generated by “Add Service Reference” tools are too long for TFS (Not the fault of the tool, more the fault of the (TFS/.net api/win api) for not supporting longer file names…</p>    <p>2. Every time we update/add new service reference it tries to re-add the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig file (DON”T WANT THAT)</p> </blockquote>  <p>After about 1/2 a day looking for alternatives to using the built in tool, and since the wcf svcutil doesn’t generate code Silverlight can use. I stumbled upon this blog <b><a href="http://www.atrevido.net/blog/2008/12/02/Command+Line+WCF+Proxy+Generation+For+Silverlight+2+RTM.aspx">Command line WCF Proxy Generation for Silverlight 2 RTM</a></b> where he figured out how to use the same dll VS uses to generate the source and wrapped it into a little console app… After chatting w/ him on his blog’s Live Messenger plugin, (very cool by the way) he emailed me the exe he’s using in his production app (that had a couple bug fixes since his original blog post. He told me just to use <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/" target="_blank">Reflector</a> to get at the source because it was very basic.</p>  <p>And so I did, and ended up with a pretty good solution to the problems above. (Sucks that I spent a day of dev time on this crap, but oh well…)</p>  <p>I wrote a T4 template that will generate all the reference.cs code needed in our Silverlight project. Instead of describing the template itself (since this post has gotten long alredy) I’ll include a project with a sample of how it works.</p>  <p>Some of the features you get using this template are:</p>  <ol>   <li>It solves the two issues stated above      <ol>       <li>Only one file generated.&#160; (None of the VS generated garbage metadata files)</li>        <li>No re-add of the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig file to the project.</li>     </ol>   </li>    <li>With the use of the T4 template (this is in our app, not in the sample below) you can put other logic needed when generating a service reference.      <ol>       <li>We are using it to update the Web.Config’s WCF aspnet compatibility flag so we can get at the wsdl and setting it back when done updating the service reference…          <br />&lt;serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; </li>     </ol>   </li>    <li>You can set some properties that will tell the tool to generate the types as “internal” (if you want)      <blockquote>       <p>Note: you have to add the correct InternalsVisibleTo for this to work</p>        <p>[assembly: System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleTo(&quot;System.Runtime.Serialization&quot;)]          <br /></p>     </blockquote>   </li> </ol>  <p>Here’s the sample project with examples of both a normal reference, and the same reference using the T4 template.</p>

This was great.  We used the concept to modify the code dom and add DebuggerNonUser code attributes to every class.  This allowed us to ignore the web service proxies when performing code coverage.<br /><br />Thanks for the post.</div>

Jason,<br /><br />Awesome post, thanks. I just figured out that i couldn&#39;t use overloading on my wcf service methods. But if you create the reference.cs your self it is possible. But writing the whole service ref. is to time-costly. This is the perfect solution for that. Thanks for posting!<br /><br />Vincent Ottens</div>

<p>&#160;</p>  <p>What is it?</p>  <p>StatLight is your first class TDD/BDD/(Insert your testing style here) tool for Silverlight. Its main focus is developer productivity.</p>  <p>(The website is young, however the tool is ready to go… <a title="StatLight&#39;s home website." href="http://www.StatLight.net">Download StatLight here</a>)</p>  <p>In the realm of Silverlight, the tooling support has not had the chance to catch up to what you might have come to expect from normal .net development. When developing Silverlight applications using a test driven style, with the current tooling, it can become a little more tedious than one might like. </p>  <p>A number of testing methodologies have sprung up to enable some sort of testing for Silverlight developers; however, few actually run the tests in the browser.</p>  <p>Below is a short list of features StatLight currently has.</p>  <h4>Features:</h4>  <ol>   <li>In browser runner to test how your code will “actually” run in the wild. </li>    <li>TeamCity Continuous Integration support </li>    <li>Smooth Console Runner      <ol>       <li>One time runner (screenshot below)<a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/Sdtexix3VSI/AAAAAAAAAFw/tj48fdwRad8/s1600-h/image8.png">           <br /><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SdteyAUbPZI/AAAAAAAAAF0/23thaH-98lI/image_thumb6.png?imgmax=800" width="521" height="292" /></a> </li>        <li>Continuous Integration runner          <ol>           <li>This runner will startup and watches for any re-builds of your text xap file. Every time you re-build it will pick up the new test xap and immediately start running the tests. </li>            <li>This feature gives the most as far as developer productivity. </li>            <li>I will put out a video to show how best to use it soon… </li>         </ol>       </li>     </ol>   </li>    <li>Tag/Filtering support (to narrow down the tests run at a given time) </li>    <li>XUnit support leveraging <a href="/2009/02/xunit-light-for-silverlight">XUnit (Light)</a> </li>    <li>MSTest support.
